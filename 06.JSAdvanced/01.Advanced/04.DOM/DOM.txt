DOM
Document Object Model

I. Document with a Logical Tree

1. Document Object Model (DOM)

- DOM represents the document as nodes and objects
 - That way, the programming languages can connect to the page
- DOM is a standard of how to 
 - Get HTML element
 - Change HTML element
 - Add HTML element
 - Delete HTML element
 
2. HTML DOM

- This is an Object Model for HTML, which defines
 - HTML elemens as objects
 - properties
 - methods
 - events
 
II. Changing the HTML

1. DOM methods

- DOM Methods - actions you can perform on HTML elements
- DOM Properties - values of HTML elemens that you can set or change

III. Modify the DOM Tree (DOM Manipulations)

1. Selection of Elements
- The most common ways to find a element in HTML document is by;
 - id - getElementById
 - tagName - getElementsByTagName
 - className - getElementByClassName
 - CSS selector - querySelector();
 
2. DOM Manipulations
- innerHTML
- attributes
- setAttribute()
- style.property

3. DOM Manipulations Prt2
- removeChild()
- appendChild()
- replaceChild()
- document.write()

IV. DOM Properties and HTML Attributes

1. Properties vs. Attributes
- Attributes are define by HTML
- Properties are define by DOM 

- Attributes initialize DOM properties
 * Property values can change;
 * Attribute values can't;
 
- The HTML attribute and DOM property are not the same thing, even when they have the same name

V. Parents and Child Elements

1. Parent Element
Every DOM elemens has a perent, exept the root and can be access by .parent
2. Child Element - Also a parent can have a child and if so it can be accessed by .children

VI. DOM Events
- Events are actions or occurrences
- They allow JS to register different event handlers on elements
- Events are normally used  in combination with function 
- The function will not be executed before the event occur

VII. The Build-In Browser Object Model
expose some object like window, screen, navigator, history, location and so on and so on
