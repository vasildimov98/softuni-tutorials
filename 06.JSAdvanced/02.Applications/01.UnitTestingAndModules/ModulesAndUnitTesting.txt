Unit Testing 
Modules, Unit Testing, Assertion

I. Definition, Import, Export (Modules)

1. Modules
- Group / set of functionality that are related and work together for the same goal;
- Group related behavior
- Resolve naming collision
- Expose only public behavior
 - They do not populate the global scope with unnecessary objects

2. Approaches for Modules
- Using IIFE
- Using Nodejs require/export
- Using ES2015 import/export

3. IIFE
- Essential for JS front end
- Expose only needed behavior/objects to the global scope

4. Node.js Modules
- use exports and require()
- internal modules need to be exported before being required
- In Nodejs each file has its own scope

5. ES2015 Modules
- Browsers modules system
- Export and import always object
- Canno work outside of file that is not describe as module

II. Unit testing
Definition, Structure, Examples, Frameworks

1. Unit testing definition
- A unit test test is a peace of code that checks whether certain functionality works as expected
- Allows developers to see where & why errors occur
- Easier maintanance of the code base
- Faster development (Test driven development)
- Automated way to find code wrongness

III. Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai
1. What is Mocha?
- Feature-rich JS test framework
- Provides common testing functions including it, describe and the main function that runs tests
- Usually used together with chai

2. What is Chai?
- a library with many assertions
- allows the ussage of a lot of different assertions such as assert.equal
