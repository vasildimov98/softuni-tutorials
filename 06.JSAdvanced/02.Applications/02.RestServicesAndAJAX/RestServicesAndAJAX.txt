Rest Services and AJAX
HTTP, RESTful Web Services, AJAX Concepts, XMLHttpRequest

I. HTTP Protocol
1. HTTP Basics
- HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
 - Text-based client server protocol for the internet
 - For transferring Web resources 
 - Request-response based
 
2. HTTP Request Methods
- HTTP defines methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

II. Chrome Dev Tools, Fiddler, Postman
III. REST and RESTful Services
- Representational State Transfer
 - Architecture for client-server communication over HTTP
 - Resources have URI (address)
 - Can be created/retrieved/modified/deleted
- RESTful API/RESTful Service
 - Provides access to server-side resources via HTTP and REST
 
III. AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
1. What is AJAX
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
 - Background loading of dynamic content/data
 - Load data from the Web server and render it
- Two types of AJAX
 - Partial page rendering
  - Load HTML fragment + show it in the div
 JSON service = Loads JSON object and displays it 

2. What is a Promise
- A promise is a asynchronous function that my happen or produce a value at some point

- State:
 - Pending: operation still running
 - Fulfilled - operation finished
 - Failed - operation failed
 
3. What is Fetch
- The fetch() method allows making network requests
- It is simmilar to XMLHttpRequest(XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API:
 - Use Promises
 - Enables simpler and cleaner API
 - Makes code more readable and maintainable
 
4. Basic Fetch Request
- The response of a fetch() request is a Stream object
- The reading of the stream happens asynchronously
- When the json() method is called, a Promise is returned
 - The response status is checked before the parsing the response as JSON
 
5. Chaining Promises
- When working with a JSON API, you can
 - Define the status and JSON parsing in separate functions
 - the function returns promises which can be chained
 
6. Get Request
- Fetch Api uses GET method, but we can change that to thee other requests methods
