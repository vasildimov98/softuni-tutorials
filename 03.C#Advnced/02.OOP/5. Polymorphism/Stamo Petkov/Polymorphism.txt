Polymorphism - override and overloads methods

I. Polymorphism
- This is object that have different meaning depending on the context
- Polymorphism is the third column on the OOP, after inheritence and interfaces and abstraction 

1. Polymorphism in OOP - ability of and object to take on many forms
Person IS A Person
Person IS A Mammal
Person IS AN Animal
Person IS AN Object

2. Reference Type and object type
- Varianbles are saved in a reference type
- You can use only reference methods
- If you need an object method you need you need to cast it or override

3. Keyword IS and AS
- IS statement support pattern matching
- Type pattern test wheater an expression can be converted to a specific type and cast it to a variable
- Constant Pattern - test wheater an expression evaluates to a specified constant value
- var pattern match that always succeeds and binds the value of an expression to a new local variable

4. Keyword AS
- AS works only with reference type

5. Types of Polymorphism
A. Runtime 
B. Compile time also know as Static Polymorphism
Argument list could differ in 
- number of parameters
- data type of parameters
- Order of type parameters

6. Rules for overloading a method
- Signature should be different (number, tyoe, order of arguments)

Return type is not part of the signiture
Overloading can take place in the same class or in its sub-classes
Constructor can be overloaded

7. Runtime Polymorphism
- Has two distinct aspects
- At run tume, objects of a derived class may be trated as objects of a base class in places, such as method parametersand collections or arrays
- Base classes may define and implement virtual methods 
- Derived classes can overrider
- they provide their own definition and implementation
At run time, they call the write override

8. Rules for overloading Methods
-Overriding must take place in any sub-classes
-The overriding method and the base must have the same return type and the same signature
-Base method must have the virtual keyword
-Overriding method must have the abstract or override keyword
-Private and static methods cannot be overridden
