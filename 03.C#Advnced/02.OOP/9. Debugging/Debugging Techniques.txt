Debugging is proccess if finding and than fixing or bypassing the error

Errors are logical and runtime error 
Steps of debugging

1. StartWith the problem 
2. Isolate the source of the problem

Debugging tools help identify coding error at various stages 

Debugging vs Testing 

Testing a means of initial detection of errors - says smth does not work, without saying way
Debugging - a mean of diagnosing and correcting the error and finding why does not work

We should aim to write legacy code. In Other words we should be able to read the code after years

Visual Studio Debugger give us:
Adding breakpoints 
Visualize the program flow
Control the flow of execution
Data tips
Wathch variables
Debugging multithreaded programs
