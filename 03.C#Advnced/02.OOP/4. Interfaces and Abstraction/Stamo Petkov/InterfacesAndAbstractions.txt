Interfaces and Abstraction 

I. Achieving Abstraction
1. What is Abstraction - Preserving information that is relevant in the given context and forgeting things that are irrelevant in that context!

2.Abstraction in OOP - means ignoring irrelevant members and emphasizing the ones relevant to the context of the project we develop
- Abstraction helps managing complexity
- Abstraction lets yoyu focus on what the object does instead how it does it

3. How to achieve abstraction 

A. Interfaces
B. Abstract class

II. Working with Interfaces
1. Interfaces
- Contains only the signatures of the class members (prop, method, events or indexes)
- Can be inherit one or more times 
- When a base type list contains a base class and interfaces, the base class must come first in the list

III. Abstract classes and methods
- Cannot be instantiated
- can contain abstract method and accessors

1. Abstract method
- they are must be implemented virtual method
