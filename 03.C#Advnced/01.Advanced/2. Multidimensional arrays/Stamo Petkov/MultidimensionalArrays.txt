Multidimensional Array

multidimensional arrays are /n
arrays with more than one dimension.

most used one is 2-dimensional arrays;

Creating multidimensional arrays -
 - with key word new 
 - must specify the size of each dimension [2,3]
 
Accessing N-dimension element we put the the row and than col
var result = arr[row, col]

We could also set value;

When we print matrix we need to use nested for-loop;

As much deeper we go in nested loop - the loop becomes more 
dinamic

JaggedArray are dimensions with diff size 
In other words this is array with arrays;
