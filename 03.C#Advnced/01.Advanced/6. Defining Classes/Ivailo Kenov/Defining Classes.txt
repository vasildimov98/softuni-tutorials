Defining Classes

Abstract Data Type(ADT) - representation hidden from the client 

- you don't need to know the implemantation to use ADT

Classes on the other hand is the actual implementation 

to create an object simple way without object or classes 

var cat = new
{
Name
Age 
};

you cant have methods that way, if you want have same data type, you cant put in list, you ahve to safe it by var(), 

That way is called anonymous type

To solve this problem above we define classes 

it has:
Keyword - class
Name - Cat() - PascalCase and descriptive nouns
{
members- field, method, proparty 
} 
avoid abbreviation 

Class has:
1. Field = saves information for the object and they are define as private, so nobody can see them! 
****private means nobody exept the Cat can reach the fields 
*** access modifer  are all this privite, public keywords that define the members-

proparties are public and have get and set 

Getter and Setter are fast way to create a method for GetName() and SetName()

Constructor helps to be shure there are valid data
