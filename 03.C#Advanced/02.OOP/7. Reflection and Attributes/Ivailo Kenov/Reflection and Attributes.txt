Reflection and Attribute 

What? Why? Where? When? - reflection

1.What is Metaprogramming?
- Programming technique,in which computer programs have the ability
 to tread other programs as their data 

Programs can be design to:
- Read
- Generate
- Analyze
- Transform
- Modify itself

2. What is reflection?
- The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage?
- Programs can examine information abount themselves

3. When do we use it?

- to make code ectendible
- to reduce code length significatly
- easier maintenance 
- easier testing

4. Where do we use it? 
if it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is prefarable to avoid it

cons of reflection: 
1. Performance overhead
2. Security restriction
3. Exposure of internals

By using Activator we can create instance dynamically

5. Binding Flags
- enums that specifies what kinds of data we are looking up!
