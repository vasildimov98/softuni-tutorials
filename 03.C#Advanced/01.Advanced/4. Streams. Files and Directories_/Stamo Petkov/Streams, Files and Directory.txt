File Streams and Directory

Streams are means for transfaring (reading and writing) data

Diff types of streams are available to access diff data source: 

File access, network access, memory streams and others

Streams are opened before using them and closed after that and this rgulate what is stream and what is not!

We usually use buffers to read files

We read the buffer till the length of the streams

Buffer safes n bytes of steam

When we have large memory type we have to be careful what we leave open and close 

Readers and Writers are classes that facilitate the work of stream

We can read and write lisnes like in the Console

We can use Binary too and saves the data in binary data 

We can ReadInt32, ReadChar, ReadBoolean

Using Statement

we can use it outside the classes to say which namespace or assebly we are using, however if we use inside a method it means using it with a object and implements the interface IDisposable -> this object knows how to destroys itselfs

We control the resources
