'''''Lucasfilm Limited v Ainsworth''''' was a 2011 court ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_ps.pdf |title=The Supreme Court Press Summary |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-07-30 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Lucasfilm Ltd v Ainsworth |year=2011 |court=UKSC |num=39 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned an intellectual property dispute over the production of Lucasfilm's [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper]] costumes by model maker [[Andrew Ainsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/870603-george-lucas-defeated-by-star-wars-helmet-man-andrew-ainsworth |title=George Lucas defeated by Star Wars helmet man Andrew Ainsworth |publisher=Metro.co.uk |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Ainsworth argued that the helmets, which he continues to manufacture and sell, were functional props covered only by design right legislation, as opposed to Lucasfilm's assertion that they were sculptures or art which fall under copyright law.&lt;ref name="The Lucasfilm empire strikes out"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/european/the-lucasfilm-empire-strikes-out/article2112181/ |title=The Lucasfilm empire strikes out |publisher=theglobeandmail.com |accessdate=2011-07-31 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design right protection is retained for 15 or 10 years, copyright protection can last considerably longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8665299/Star-Wars-prop-maker-wins-right-to-sell-Stormtrooper-helmets-in-UK.html |title=Star Wars prop maker wins right to sell Stormtrooper helmets in UK |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2011-07-27|accessdate=2011-07-30 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case background ==
The Stormtrooper character first appeared in the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.  The character was conceived by George Lucas, designed by artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]], sculpted by from Liz Moore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = DeBord | first = Jason | title = Facebook Hosts Ongoing Public Debate Over Original Sculptor Credit for Star Wars Stormtrooper | publisher = OriginalProp.com | date = March 16, 2011 | url = http://www.originalprop.com/blog/2011/03/16/facebook-hosts-ongoing-public-debate-over-original-sculptor-credit-for-star-wars-stormtrooper-andrew-ainsworth-or-liz-moore-brian-muir/ | accessdate = September 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = DeBord | first = Jason | title = Star Wars "Prototype" Stormtrooper Helmets | publisher = OriginalProp.com | date = June 24, 2008 | url = http://www.originalprop.com/blog/2008/06/24/star-wars-prototype-stormtrooper-helmets/ | accessdate = September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally molded from the existing designs by Andrew Ainsworth. Before the case came to court, Ainsworth had sold replica Stormtrooper outfits online for many years causing [[Lucasfilm]] to sue for infringement of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_Judgment.pdf |title=Judgement: Lucasfilm Limited and others (Appellants) v Ainsworth and another (Respondents) |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-31 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Lucasfilm empire strikes out"/&gt; Ainsworth did not defend the 2006 case in the US courts and [[Default judgment|defaulted]]. Accordingly, the [[United States District Court]] for the [[Central District of California]] gave summary judgement in favour of Lucasfilm, awarding a [[USD]] $20 million compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Lucasfilm Ltd.

In the English courts, Lucasfilm was represented by [[Michael Bloch (barrister)|Michael Bloch QC]] and [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption QC]].&lt;ref name=SCUK/&gt;

== Court ruling ==
The Supreme Court ruled that the Stormtrooper helmets could not be considered a [[sculpture]] for the purposes of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. On the issue of the justiciability of a foreign copyright claim, the court ruled that providing that there is [[in personam]] jurisdiction over a defendant, an English court does have jurisdiction in this area. On this point, the case was distinguished from ''[[Mozambique rule|British South Africa v Companhia de Mocambique]]'',&lt;ref name="Mozambique"&gt;''[[British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique]]'' [1893] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 602, [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; that expressed the general principle that English courts have no jurisdiction to entertain an action to determine title, where claims applied to foreign intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=SCUK&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_Judgment.pdf |title=Judgement: Lucasfilm Limited and others (Appellants) v Ainsworth and another (Respondents) |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-31 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their conclusions on the justiciability question, Lord Walker and Lord Collins stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Lucasfilm v Ainsworth'' [2011] UKSC 39, [105].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|We have come to the firm conclusion that, in the case of a claim for infringement of copyright of the present kind, the claim is one over which the English court has jurisdiction, provided that there is a basis for in personam jurisdiction over the defendant, or, to put it differently, the claim is justiciable. It is clear that much of the underpinning of the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' rule]] and the decision in [[Potter v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd|''Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd'']] &lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|88|1906|litigants=[[Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/88.pdf (1906)&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;479] |date=20 March 1906 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been eroded. All that is left of the ''Moçambique'' rule (except to the extent that it is modified by the Brussels I Regulation) is that there is no jurisdiction in proceedings for infringement of rights in foreign land where the proceedings are “principally concerned with a question of the title, or the right to possession, of that property".&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt;{{rp|at [106]}}}}

They went on further to state:
{{cquote|The basis for what remains of the rule was said by the House of Lords in the ''Moçambique'' case to be that controversies should be decided in the country of the situs of the property because the right of granting it was vested in “the ruler of the country” and in the ''Hesperides'' case to be the maintenance of comity and the avoidance of conflict with foreign jurisdictions. It is possible to see how the rationale of the ''Moçambique'' rule can be applied to patents, at any rate where questions of validity are involved.&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt;{{rp|at [107]}}}}

'''Elstree Studios''' is a generic term which can refer to several current and defunct British [[film studio]]s and television studios based in or around the towns of [[Borehamwood]] and [[Elstree]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Studios have been located there since film production began in the area during 1914.

While some facilities have been built and demolished since then, two sites remain in use in Borehamwood: [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] on Shenley Road and the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] on Eldon Avenue.

==History and facilities==
Despite being called "Elstree Studios", only one studio has ever been located in Elstree itself, the remainder residing in the adjacent town of Borehamwood. When the studios were being established, Elstree was significantly larger than Borehamwood. Nowadays, Borehamwood is larger, but the old names have remained in use.

The [[civil parish]] that contains the town was called "[[Elstree (parish)|Elstree]]". The local railway station was originally known as "Elstree"&lt;ref&gt;{{Butt-Stations|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; (nowadays, it is called "{{stnlnk|Elstree &amp; Borehamwood}}"). The local [[telephone exchange]] was also called "Elstree".

===Eldon Avenue Studios, Borehamwood===
{{Main|BBC Elstree Centre}}
The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. Production ceased during 1917, and the studio was sold to the [[Ideal Film Company]] who used the site up until 1924.

During 1928, the studio was sold to [[Ludwig Blattner]] who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording. The Blattner Studio was leased to [[Joe Rock]] Productions during 1934, which purchased the site two years later. Rock Productions built four new large stages. The site was again sold, and taken over by the [[British National Films Company]] between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the [[British government]] for war work.

During 1953, the studios were bought by [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], mainly for television production and were later sold to Lew Grade's [[Associated Television]] (ATV). The Eldon Avenue centre became the main television production hub for ATV. The smaller Studios A and B were used for schools and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmes&lt;ref&gt;Barfe [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHbFLkrXezMC&amp;pg=PT108 ''Turned Out Nice Again''], p.108&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ATV [[Morecambe and Wise]] series ''[[Two of a Kind (UK TV series)|Two of a Kind]]'' (1961–68) and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976–81).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jay Jones [https://books.google.com/books?id=4eVrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT126 ''Jim Henson: The Biography'', London: Random House, 2013, p.126]&lt;/ref&gt;

When ATV was restructured as [[Central Independent Television]] in 1982, one of the conditions of its licence renewal by the governing body of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], was that ATV should leave any London-centric facilities and become more focused on the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], the part of the United Kingdom to which it broadcast ITV programmes. They remained in operation by Central up until July 1983. The [[BBC]] bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce its new soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' (first aired on 19 February 1985). In addition to ''EastEnders'', many other programmes have been made there including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'', ''[[Grange Hill]]'', ''[[Hangar 17]]'' and ''[[Holby City]]''.

===Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood===
{{Main|Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)}}
[[File:Elstree Studios - Entrance Area.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s).]]
British National Pictures Ltd. purchased {{convert|40|acre}} of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. The first film produced there was ''[[Madame Pompadour (1927 film)|Madame Pompadour]]'' (1927). The company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and a second stage was ready for production in 1928.

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] made ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929), the first British [[talkie]] at the studios in 1929. At the end of the [[silent film|silent-film]] era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the [[British &amp; Dominions Film Corporation]]. BIP became [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] (ABPC) in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|last2=Chibnall|first2=Steve|title=Historical Dictionary of British Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8SRjwJqwukC&amp;pg=PA43|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, MD and Plymouth, England|year=2013|page=43|isbn=9780810880269}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the studios were used by the [[War Office]] for storage.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Warner Brothers]] acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. In 1969, [[EMI]] gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[Bryan Forbes]] was appointed head of production of the film studio (see [[EMI Films]]). His tenure was short-lived and marked by financial problems, brought about by deliberately withheld funding and failed projects. Forbes resigned in 1971.&lt;ref name=guardian_batty&gt;Batty D.

In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. This was halted, but only with significant job cuts and closure of some facilities. The studio's immediate survival was secured through the facilities being used for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' sequels]] and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jim Henson]]. In 1979, [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the [[CT Scanner]], and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt;

The studios were put up for sale in 1985. Acquired by the entertainment and property company [[Brent Walker]], most of the [[backlot]] and several facilities were demolished to build a [[Tesco]] superstore. A "Save Our Studios" campaign led to the site being purchased by [[Hertsmere]] Borough Council in February 1996 and management company, Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd was appointed to run the studios in 2000.

===Station Road Studios, Borehamwood===
{{Main|Gate Studios}}
A single large stage was built in Station Road in 1928 by Whitehall Films Ltd, but the company was wound up in 1930. In 1935, [[Julius Hagen]], the owner of [[Twickenham Studios]], bought the site and formed a new company, JH Studios.

Financial difficulties forced Hagen to sell the studios to MP Productions in 1937.

During World War II, the studio was used by the government for storage.

In 1950, the site was bought by [[J. Arthur Rank, Baron Rank|J. Arthur Rank]], who renamed it [[Gate Studios]] and made religious films.

Production ceased in 1957, and the site was sold to Andrew Harkness, a manufacturer of cinema screens. Harkness Screens moved out of the site in 2004 having established a global manufacturing base in France and the US and relocated its UK operation to a new production facility in Stevenage. The building in Borehamwood was demolished in 2006 to make way for apartments new properties, the development being named Gate Studios in homage to the former site.

===British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood===
[[File:1936-elstree-film-studio-fire.jpg|thumb|256px|1936. Fire destroys three stages of British and Dominion Studios. From the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' 15 February 1936]]
{{Main|British and Dominions Imperial Studios}}
In 1930, British and Dominion bought three new sound stages from British International Pictures Ltd on the adjoining site before their construction was completed. [[Alexander Korda]] made one of his greatest successes at the studio, ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933), which starred [[Charles Laughton]] as the King. The film's success in the United States and elsewhere persuaded [[United Artists]] and [[Prudential plc|The Prudential]] to invest in Korda's proposed [[Denham Film Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Warren ''British Film Studios: An Illustrated History'', London: B.T. Batsford, 2001, p.26, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Film production continued until 1936 when fire destroyed the three stages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DB1kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MHsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=elstree&amp;pg=3532%2C4449867 "British Film Studios at Elstree Destroyed in $2,250,000 Blaze"].  ''[[Calgary Herald|Calgary Daily Herald]]''. 10 February 1936. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; British and Dominion made a substantial investment in [[Pinewood Studios]] and moved production to [[Iver Heath]], Buckinghamshire. The support buildings that remained after the fire were sold off to various companies including Frank Landsdown Ltd, which opened a film vault service. The Rank Organisation bought the music stage for the production of documentary films. It later became the headquarters of the film and sound-effect libraries.

===MGM British, Borehamwood===
{{Main|MGM-British Studios}}
Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937, but its plans collapsed and the facility was soon sold to Rank, who never used it for making films. After a brief period owned by [[Prudential plc|the Prudential]], the studios were purchased by the American film studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MGM Buy Film Studios at Elstree|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 April 1944|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was renamed [[MGM-British Studios]].&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; After improvements the studio contained seven stages totalling over {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|-3}} of floor space. MGM sometimes leased the studios to other film companies including the [[20th Century Fox]]-produced ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958), for which a large set of a Chinese town, complete with artificial lakes, covering some 500,000 square feet, was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stages were taken up with the sets for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) over its extended production schedule, and indeed [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film is sometimes blamed for making the studios financially unviable. The facility continued to be used until 1970 when MGM closed the studios. The American company formed a short-lived deal with EMI, while the site of its former studios was redeveloped for industrial use and housing.

===Danziger Studios, Elstree===
In 1956 the [[The Danzigers|Danziger brothers]] converted a wartime plane engine testing factory into a studio they called New Elstree,&lt;ref name="Vahimagi"&gt;Tise Vahimagi [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/773807/index.html "Danzigers, The"], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; which was located to the west of the [[Aldenham]] reservoir. It was used mainly for television production and second features, but was closed by 1962 and sold in 1965.&lt;ref name="Vahimagi"/&gt;

===Millennium Studios, Elstree Way, Borehamwood===
Established in 1993, the Millennium Studios on the south side of Elstree Way offered television and film production space together with associated services. Millennium Studios have now relocated to [[Thurleigh]] near [[Bedford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumstudios.co.uk|title=Millennium Studios|date=8 December 2010|website=Millenniumstudios.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domenico Monardo''' (born November 29, 1939), known as '''Meco''', is an American record producer and musician, as well as the name of his band or production team. Meco is best known for his 1977 [[space disco]] version of the [[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band|''Star Wars'' theme]] from his album ''[[Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk]]''; both the single and album were [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] in the US.

==Early life and education==
Meco Monardo was born in [[Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania|Johnsonburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], to parents of Italian descent. Building model ships, science fiction and movies were some of his boyhood preoccupations. His father played the [[valve trombone]] in a small Italian band, and through him Meco got his first musical education.&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; Meco wanted to play the drums, but his father convinced him that the trombone was the right instrument, and at nine that was the instrument with which he was to stay. However, for Meco, the [[slide trombone]] was his choice, troublesome as it was for the small-statured boy to extend the slide fully at first. He joined the [[School band#High school bands|high school band]] while still attending elementary school.&lt;ref name= billboardbook/&gt; At 17, he won a scholarship to the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; which provided him with a solid classical and [[jazz]] music education.

==Career==
While at Eastman School of Music, together with his two friends [[Chuck Mangione]] and [[Ron Carter]], he started the Eastman School of Music [[jazz band]]. When he enrolled at [[West Point]], he also played in the Cadet Band.&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt;

After serving in the US Army, Meco moved to [[New York City]] and joined [[Kai Winding]]'s&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; four-trombone band, and then from 1965 to 1974 he went on as a [[studio musician]]. Originally not inclined toward [[pop music]], Meco's heart changed when he heard [[Petula Clark]]'s "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]." He began [[arranging]] for musicians, for example the [[horn section]] on [[Tommy James]]' "[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]" and the [[Neil Diamond]] series of [[Coca-Cola]] commercials.

As a [[session musician]] he played the trombone with acts like [[Tommy James]], [[Diana Ross]], and David Barretto. Although Meco focused on producing in the late 1970s, he contracted the horns and performed on Diana Ross' 1980 album ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]'' as a favor to producer (and neighbor) [[Nile Rodgers]]. His solo on the single "[[I'm Coming Out]]" is notable because of the rarity of [[trombone]] features on post-big-band era pop records.&lt;ref name= Dolista&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.comicgenius.com/discofever/disco_profiles/meco/meco_profile.htm |website= comicgenius.com| title= Disco Profiles: Meco – The Funk is With Him| first= Ed |last= Dolista |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232328/http://www.comicgenius.com/discofever/disco_profiles/meco/meco_profile.htm |archive-date= January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1973, Meco and [[Tony Bongiovi]] were part of a trio that formed the production company Disco Corporation of America. From 1974 to 1976, Meco worked as a [[record producer]]. The team of Meco, Bongiovi, Jay Ellis, and [[Harold Wheeler (musician)|Harold Wheeler]] produced the 1974 [[Gloria Gaynor]] hit "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]." [[Carol Douglas]]' "[[Doctor's Orders (song)|Doctor's Orders]]" was among the other productions of that period.

===''Star Wars'' theme===
On Wednesday May 25, 1977, Meco watched the [[20th Century-Fox]] soon-to-be blockbuster hit ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' on its opening day. By Thursday night, he had seen the film four more times, and attended several more screenings over the weekend.

He then got the idea to make a disco version of the score by [[John Williams]] and contacted [[Neil Bogart]] at [[Casablanca Records]] to pitch the project. Only after both the picture itself as well as the [[Star Wars (soundtrack)|original score]] had become huge hits did Bogart agree to help Meco realize his idea. Contact was established with [[Millennium Records]], then a Casablanca subsidiary, and this became Meco's first record company. Here Meco rejoined with Tony Bongiovi as well as [[Harold Wheeler (musician)|Harold Wheeler]] who had also been part of the team behind "Never Can Say Goodbye" in 1974. Lance Quinn was also part of the Meco team, and the different roles played by the four musicians is described by Meco himself in a 1999 interview with his fan Web site:

In a matter of just three weeks they arranged and recorded ''[[Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk]]''. Although the album was nominated for "Best Instrumental Pop performer" in 1977, the award ultimately went to John Williams for the original soundtrack album.

===The band Meco===
For a period of four months there was even a show band assembled to perform to Meco's disco music in public venues. However, the band was not involved in the making of the music. This initiative was organized by Norby Walters, a booking agent for discos. The band members (pictured in this article) toured the U.S. and Canada as a high energy show band called '''Lemon Tree'''. Norby Walters booked and also managed the band before the Star Wars project. Band personnel was Carmine Giovinazzo, Stan Glogicheski, Tommy Rocco, Tony Abruzzo, and Tony "Butch" Gerace.

===Other soundtracks become "Meco-ized"===
In the fall of 1977, Meco's second album was released. It was another rearranged science-fiction movie soundtrack, ''[[Encounters of Every Kind]]'', based on John Williams music of the movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', from which three singles were released: "Topsy," "Meco's Theme," and "Theme from 'Close Encounters.'"

Meco's third album came in early 1978, and this time it was the [[Musical selections in The Wizard of Oz|music from]] ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which got transformed into a disco album by the same name, as Meco described: "It is my best work, bar none." From this album came the [[chart-topper|hit single]] "Themes from The Wizard of Oz: '[[Over the Rainbow]]'/'[[We're off to See the Wizard]].'"

In the fall of 1978, Millennium merged with [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Since he had developed a deep-bonded working relationship with Neil Bogart and other staff at Casablanca Records (Millennium and Casablanca having cooperated closely), Meco decided to move to Casablanca. Casablanca released the fourth Meco album, ''Superman &amp; Other Galactic Heroes'', featuring two hit singles, "Superman Theme" and "Love Theme From Superman." This was yet another Meco makeover of an original John Williams score.

In 1979, the fifth album, ''Moondancer'', was released, and with it the hit singles "Moondancer," "[[Grazing in the Grass]]," and "Devil's Delight." In 1980, Meco's sixth album, ''Music From Star Trek and Music from The Black Hole,'' was released, featuring the song "Theme From 'Star Trek.'" The movie ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) featured an original soundtrack composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. Meco also created ''Meco Plays Music from The Empire Strikes Back'', which was a 10" EP containing a mash-up of various themes from the John Williams score to ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' for RSO Records.

The last album that Meco made for Casablanca, his seventh, which came out in 1981, was ''Impressions of [[An American Werewolf in London]]'', based on the soundtrack from the 1981 feature film ''An American Werewolf in London''. After this LP, Meco's tenure with Casablanca was over.

Meco also recorded for RSO Records (''Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Christmas in the Stars'') as well as Arista Records (''Ewok Celebration'', ''Pop Goes the Movies'', ''Swingtime's Greatest Hits'') and with Columbia on the single ''The Raiders March''.  His ''Hooked on Instrumentals'' was released on CD and Cassette on the [[K-Tel]] label in the US, and Mercury released a CD compilation of his greatest hits, ''The Best of Meco'' in 1997.&lt;ref name= Dolista /&gt;

===Retirement from music===
According to Meco, "When disco was new, it was fresh and exciting because it was different. But pretty soon it became too cookie-cutter and wore itself out." He left the music industry in 1985. After three years of "doing nothing but playing golf," he started working as a [[commodities broker]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name= Dolista /&gt;

'''''Han''''' is a [[monotypic taxon|monotypic genus]] of [[agnostid]] [[trilobite]], whose sole member is '''''Han solo'''''.  The type specimen of ''H. solo'' was found in marine strata of the Arenig to Llanvirn-aged [[Zitai Formation]] of Middle [[Ordovician]] southern [[China]], and is named after the [[Han Solo|character]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.

==Taxonomy==
This taxon was erected in 2005, based upon fossil material found in beds of lower [[Zitai Formation]] exposed in [[Maocaopu]], Reshi, [[Taoyuan County, Hunan|Taoyuan County]] in north [[Hunan]], [[China]]. Fossil material include a [[cephalon (trilobite anatomy)|cephalon]] and two [[pygidium|pygidia]]. It was found to belong to family [[Diplagnostidae]], subfamily [[Pseudagnostinae]]; it was originally thought to be most closely related to the genus ''[[Pseudorhaptagnostus]]'', but it differed substantially from that genus in both some important diagnostic characters, and in the age of the beds in it was deposited, so a new genus was erected.&lt;ref name="Turvey 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Samuel T. Turvey | year = 2005 | title = Agnostid trilobites from the Arenig–Llanvirn of South China | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences | volume = 95 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 527–542 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=1199796 | accessdate = February 9, 2009 | doi = 10.1017/S0263593304000355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to the original publication, the generic name ''Han'' is a reference to the [[Han Chinese]], the largest [[ethnic group]] in China; and the specific epithet ''solo'' refers to the fact that the species is the youngest [[Diplagnostidae]] fossil found to that date, suggesting that it was the last surviving member of that family.&lt;ref name="Turvey 2005"/&gt; However, Samuel Turvey has stated elsewhere that he named it after [[Han Solo]] because some friends dared him to name a species after a ''[[Star Wars]]'' character.&lt;ref name="Curiosities"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/fiction.html | title = Etymology: Names from Fictional Characters | work = Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature | accessdate = February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not the only unusual scientific name erected by Turvey; in the same paper he named a new species of ''[[Geragnostus]]'' ''[[Geragnostus waldorfstatleri|G.&amp;nbsp;waldorfstatleri]]'', because of "the resemblance of the pygidial axis to the heads of [[Waldorf and Statler]], two characters from ''[[The Muppet Show]]''."&lt;ref name="Turvey 2005"/&gt;

Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the average population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a [[lightsaber]], a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered [[Blaster (Star Wars)|blaster]] [[firearm]]s. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the [[Hutt (Star Wars)|Hutt]] cartel are dominant. [[Bounty hunter]]s are often employed by both [[gangsters]] and governments. Illicit activities include [[smuggling]] and [[slavery]].

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|website=TheForce.net|date=May 26, 1999|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-date=September 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929191817/http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/archives/banthatracks08.pdf|magazine=Bantha Tracks|title=Interview: George Lucas|issue=8|year=1980|last=Lucas|first=George|access-date=October 11, 2018|archive-date=June 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623142537/http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/archives/banthatracks08.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=494}} In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."&lt;ref&gt;Worrell, Denise. ''Icons: Intimate Portraits''. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive."{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=303}} In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=312}} A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "[[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|updated]]" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.

The trilogy begins 32 years before ''Episode IV'' and follows the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gregory|last=Wakeman|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/George-Lucas-Was-Terrible-Predicting-Future-Star-Wars-68506.html|title=George Lucas Was Terrible At Predicting The Future Of Star Wars|date=December 4, 2014|website=CinemaBlend|access-date=February 28, 2019|archive-date=January 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114031020/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/George-Lucas-Was-Terrible-Predicting-Future-Star-Wars-68506.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Star Wars expanded to other media}}
From 1976 to 2014, the term ''Expanded Universe'' (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed ''Star Wars'' storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.&lt;ref name="KurtzBourdaa2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W.L.

The ''Star Wars'' canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page|website=StarWars.com|date=April 25, 2014|access-date=May 26, 2016|archive-date=September 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910044317/http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple comics series from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and novels published by [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] were produced after the announcement.

In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new ''Star Wars'' comic it had in development, which was picked up by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and published as the popular ''Dark Empire'' series (1991–1995).&lt;ref name="Dark Horse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-131/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #131 |first= Brian |last= Cronin |date=November 29, 2007 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150426232903/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-131 |archive-date= April 26, 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'' (1993–1998), ''[[Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron (comics)|X-wing Rogue Squadron]]'' (1995–1998), ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998–2006), ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'' (1999–2005), ''[[Star Wars: Empire]]'' (2002–2006), and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comics)|Knights of the Old Republic]]'' (2006–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-greatest-dark-horse-star-wars-comics-to-buy-before-1670419639|title=The Greatest Dark Horse ''Star Wars'' Comics To Buy Before They're Gone|first=James|last=Whitbrook|website=Gizmodo|date=December 12, 2014|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/star-wars/231894/star-wars-the-13-greatest-dark-horse-comics-stories|title=''Star Wars'': The 13 Greatest Dark Horse Comics Stories|first=John|last=Saavedra|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=January 4, 2015|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the ''Star Wars'' comics license would return to Marvel Comics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-moves-star-wars-comics-668377|title=Disney Moves ''Star Wars'' Comics License to Marvel|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 3, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160323165400/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-moves-star-wars-comics-668377|archive-date= March 23, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose parent company, [[Marvel Entertainment]], Disney had purchased in 2009.&lt;ref name="Disney"&gt;{{cite news | title=Disney to Acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4B |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-to-acquire-marvel-entertainment-for-4b-2009-08-31 | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=August 31, 2009 | first=David B. |last=Wilkerson| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608001308/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-to-acquire-marvel-entertainment-for-4b-2009-08-31 | archive-date= June 8, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled ''[[Star Wars (2015 comic book)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Darth Vader|Darth Vader]]'', and the limited series ''[[Star Wars: Princess Leia|Princess Leia]]''.&lt;ref name="SDCC 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/sdcc-2014-inside-marvels-new-star-wars-comics-exclusive |title=SDCC 2014: Inside Marvel's New ''Star Wars'' Comics |first=Dan |last=Brooks |website=StarWars.com |date=July 26, 2014 |access-date=August 20, 2016 |archive-date=May 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514043523/http://www.starwars.com/news/sdcc-2014-inside-marvels-new-star-wars-comics-exclusive |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-new-star-wars-titles-darth-vader-princess-leia-aaron-cassaday-gillen-larroca-waid-dodson/ |title=Force Works: Marvel Announces Three New ''Star Wars Titles'' From All-Star Creative Teams |work=[[Comics Alliance]] |first=Andrew |last=Wheeler |date=July 26, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161008145245/http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-new-star-wars-titles-darth-vader-princess-leia-aaron-cassaday-gillen-larroca-waid-dodson/|archive-date= October 8, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/07/27/sdcc-2014-marvel-announces-3-star-wars-comics |title=SDCC 2014: Marvel Announces 3 ''Star Wars'' Comics for 2015 |website= IGN|first=Joshua |last=Yehl |date=July 26, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151121190208/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/27/sdcc-2014-marvel-announces-3-star-wars-comics|archive-date= November 21, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First announced as ''Project Luminous'' at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called ''Star Wars: The High Republic'' were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics. These include ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively, that will both premiere in August 2020.&lt;ref name="StarWarsHighRepublic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-high-republic|title=LUCASFILM TO LAUNCH STAR WARS: THE HIGH REPUBLIC PUBLISHING CAMPAIGN IN 2020|date=February 24, 2020|access-date=February 25, 2020|publisher=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio novels====
{{Further|The Story of Star Wars|List of Star Wars books}}
The first ''Star Wars'' audio work is ''[[The Story of Star Wars]]'', an [[LP record|LP]] using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on [[cassette tape]] and re-released on [[Compact disc|CD]]. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Andrew |title=A new Star Wars audio-only novel will explore Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress' backstory |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284363/star-wars-audio-novel-dooku-asajj-ventress-backstory-lucasfilm |access-date=5 October 2020 |work=The Verge |date=27 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
{{Further|Star Wars (radio)}}
Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated [[campus radio]] station of his alma mater the [[University of Southern California]], licensed the ''Star Wars'' radio rights to [[KUSC-FM]] for {{US$|1}}. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with [[Ben Burtt]]'s sound effects.&lt;ref name="Encyc Radio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Collect"/&gt;

The first was written by science-fiction author [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]].

===Video games===
{{Further|Star Wars video games|List of Star Wars video games}}
The ''Star Wars'' franchise has spawned over one hundred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.igdb.com/2017/12/12/star-wars-40-years-in-gaming|title=Star Wars Infographic: 40 Years in Gaming |work=www.igdb.com |access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest [[home consoles]]. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and removed from the canon in 2014). ''Star Wars'' games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to [[Electronic Arts]].

====Early licensed games (1979–1993)====
The first officially licensed electronic ''Star Wars'' game was [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]'s 1979 table-top ''Star Wars Electronic Battle Command''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Kenner/SWBattleCommand.htm |title=Kenner ''Star Wars'' Battle Command |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coopee |first=Todd |title=''Star Wars'' Electronic Battle Command Game |url=https://toytales.ca/star-wars-electronic-battle-command-game/ |publisher=ToyTales.ca |access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Parker Brothers]] published the first ''Star Wars'' video game for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogost |first1=Ian|author-link1=Ian Bogost|last2=Montfort|first2=Nick|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|title-link=Racing the Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed soon the year later by ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Arena]]'', the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by [[Atari]]'s [[rail shooter]] [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'', with [[vector graphics]] to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/7-30-a-brief-history-of-star-war-games-part-1.html|title=A Brief History of ''Star War'' Games, Part 1 (Slide 1–6) |date=May 20, 2007|publisher=[[Tom's Hardware]]|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next game, ''[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984 video game)|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1984), has more traditional [[raster graphics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi |title=''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' |publisher=[[MobyGames]] |access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the following ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1985) has vector graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=70 |pages=82–83 |title=The making of ''The Empire Strikes Back''|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platform game]]s were made for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], including the Japan-exclusive ''[[Star Wars (1987 video game)|Star Wars]]'' (1987), an international ''[[Star Wars (1991 video game)|Star Wars]]'' (1991), and ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1992). ''[[Super Star Wars]]'' (1992) was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], with two sequels over the next two years.

====LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)====
{{Main|LucasArts}}
Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games, and founded his own development company, [[LucasArts]]. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s.

The success of the ''Star Wars'' films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By  1987, the first three films have made {{US$|2.6}}{{nbsp}}billion in merchandising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;q=convention+celebrates+star+wars+milestone&amp;pg=PA2|title=Convention celebrates 'Star Wars milestone|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=May 25, 1987|access-date=December 21, 2019|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114043221/https://books.google.com/books?id=lPdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;q=convention+celebrates+star+wars+milestone&amp;pg=PA2|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the first six films produced approximately {{US$|20}}{{nbsp}}billion in merchandising revenue.&lt;ref name=merch&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-lucas-star-wars-288513|title=The Real Force Behind 'Star Wars': How George Lucas Built an Empire|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 9, 2012|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenner made the first [[Kenner Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' action figures]] to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable.

[[Political science]] has been an important element of ''Star Wars'' since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between [[democracy]] and [[dictatorship]]. Battles featuring the [[Ewok]]s and [[Gungan]]s against the Empire and [[Trade Federation]], respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the [[Vietnam-American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|last=Lucas|first=George|title=Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace ''audio commentary''|medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|year=2001|time=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, George (2004).

===Industry===
The original ''Star Wars'' film was a huge success for [[20th Century Fox]], and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37&amp;nbsp;million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/&gt; The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David A.|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-23265-5|edition=1st paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways.

Some critics have blamed ''Star Wars'' and ''Jaws'' for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', and ''[[Annie Hall]]'' to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web |work=Decent Films Guide |author=Greydanus, Steven D. |title=An American Mythology: Why Star Wars Still Matters |url=http://www.decentfilms.com/articles/starwars |access-date=October 1, 2006 |archive-date=February 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206024753/http://www.decentfilms.com/articles/starwars |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such critic, [[Peter Biskind]], complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and [[New Hollywood]] films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of movies]]... They marched backward through the looking-glass."&lt;ref name="American" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskind"&gt;[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (1998). "Star Bucks".

New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. pp. 336–337, 343. {{ISBN|0-684-80996-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an opposing view, [[Tom Shone]] wrote that through ''Star Wars'' and ''Jaws'', Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth".&lt;ref name="Shone" /&gt;

The original ''Star Wars'' trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.&lt;ref&gt;For a sampling of the reviews, read the following:

====Fan works====
{{Main|Star Wars fan films}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing [[fan fiction]] to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|access-date=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM|title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts 'The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002|archive-date=June 29, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629011859/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/search/?q=Filmmaker%20Kevin%20Smith%20Hosts%20%60The%20Official%20Star%20Wars%20Fan%20Film%20Awards'%20On%20SCI%20FI%20Channel;%20George%20Lucas%20to%20Present%20Special%20Honor.|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Sarah|last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work= The Guardian|location= UK|date= April 7, 2008|access-date= April 15, 2008|archive-date= April 11, 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080411061922/http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.  For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hesterman |first= Sandra |journal= Australasian Journal of Early Childhood |issn= 1836-9391 |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 86–95 |title= Multiliterate Star Warians : the force of popular culture and ICT in early learning |date=December 1, 2011 |doi= 10.1177/183693911103600412|s2cid= 56078619 |url= https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/15743/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first= Stephanie |journal=Science Scope |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=0887-2376 |page=55 |title=The science of Star Wars: Integrating technology and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy |date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Susan Hatters |last2=Hall |first2=Ryan C.

'''Elstree Studios''' on Shenley Road, [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire is a British film and television production centre operated by Elstree Film Studios Limited. One of several facilities historically referred to as [[Elstree Studios]], the Shenley Road studios first opened in 1925.

The studio complex has passed through many owners during its lifetime, and is now owned by Hertsmere Borough Council. Known as the studios used for filming [[The Shining (film)|''The'' ''Shining'']], ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' (its largest stage is known as the George Lucas Soundstage), the studios are used both for film and television productions.

With the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] nearby, a number of the stages are leased to [[BBC Studioworks]], and are used for recording television productions such as ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.

==History==

===British International and Associated British===

British National Pictures Ltd. purchased {{convert|40|acre}} of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. After discord among the partners, which by this time included [[Herbert Wilcox]], their solicitor John Maxwell invested and was able to gain control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Warren ''British Film Studios: An Illustrated History'', London: B.T Batsford, 2001, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The first film produced there was ''[[Madame Pompadour (1927 film)|Madame Pompadour]]'' (1927).

By 1927, Maxwell controlled all the stock, and the company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and the second stage was ready for production in 1928. Maxwell placed [[Alfred Hitchcock]] under contract in a 3-year, 12-picture deal, and after several silents, he was responsible for ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929), the first British [[talkie]] released, which was produced at the studios. At the end of the [[silent film|silent-film]] era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the [[British &amp; Dominions Film Corporation]] (see below) with BIP retaining the remaining stages. ''[[Elstree Calling]]'' (1930), made by BIP, was reputedly Britain's first musical film.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Duncan [https://books.google.com/books?id=5yRsKstS03MC&amp;lpg=PA46 ''Alfred Hitchcock: Architect of Anxiety, 1899–1980''], Taschen, 2003, p.46 {{ISBN|978-3-8228-1591-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Conrich, Estella Tincknell [https://books.google.com/books?id=PZS5vb7nQ_UC&amp;lpg=PA32 ''Film's Musical Moments''], Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p.32. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIP became [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] (ABPC) in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|last2=Chibnall|first2=Steve|title=Historical Dictionary of British Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8SRjwJqwukC&amp;pg=PA43|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, MD and Plymouth, England|year=2013|page=43|isbn=9780810880269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell died in 1940 and during [[World War II]], the studios were used by the [[War Office]] for storage.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Warner Brothers]] acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. This was completed in 1948 and work began on ''Man on the Run'' followed by ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' starring [[Richard Todd]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].

The Shenley Road studios were frequently used in the 1960s for productions by ABPC's television arm, [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]]. Later episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' were among these. Several similar productions by [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] were also filmed there, including ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[The Baron]]'' &lt;!-- "Danger Man", according to the end credits, was shot at MGM-British in Borehamwood &amp; (later) Shepperton. --&gt;and ''[[The Champions]]''. All of these series made extensive use of a townscape standing set constructed at the rear of the studio site, originally for the 1961 [[Cliff Richard]] film ''[[The Young Ones (1961 film)|The Young Ones]]''.

===EMI and others===
[[File:Elstree Studios - Entrance Area.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s).]]
In 1969, [[EMI|Electrical and Musical Industries]] (EMI) finally gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Bryan Forbes]] was appointed head of production of the film studio (see [[EMI Films]]). [[Dennis Barker]], in his obituary of Forbes for ''[[The Guardian]]'', states that "This amounted virtually to an attempt to revive the ailing British film industry by instituting a traditional studio system with a whole slate of films in play."&lt;ref name=guardian_barker&gt;Barker, D.

Retrieved 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Under Forbes's leadership, the studio produced ''[[The Railway Children (1970 film)|The Railway Children]]'' (1970), ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Go-Between (1971 film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1971), all successful films.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;British Film Institute: [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/491680 Profile at screenline.org].

In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. Due to the sterling efforts of Mitchell and the help of John Reed who was on the board of EMI and Alan Sapper the head of the ACTT Union, he turned the studios into a Four Wall facility, which effectively meant reducing the staff to administration, with the exception of the Dubbing facility and having freelance crew being brought in by each production company. This was inevitable due to the changing nature of cinematic styles that relied increasingly on location shooting and the reduced financial involvement of EMI in its own film productions, thus rendering a permanent production staff employed full-time at the facility redundant.

Films shot at the facility over the next few years included the [[Agatha Christie]] [[mystery film]] ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]; [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977; [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980); [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s drama film ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977); and most significantly for the studio's immediate survival through a deal brokered by Andrew Mitchell, [[George Lucas]] with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' sequels]] and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jim Henson]]. This was the golden era of the construction picture, which essentially required large studio facilities to fulfill the filmmakers' vision, before [[computer-generated imagery]] technology and Elstree became synonymous with this kind of picture due to the success of the ''Star Wars'' and ''Indiana Jones'' films.

In 1979, [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the [[CT Scanner]], and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt;

===Sale, partial demolition, and present===
The studios were put up for sale in 1985. A management team beat off all other prospective buyers with the help of [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] but the team had difficulty raising their share of the purchase price and Bond took over. Soon afterwards he sold the studios to the [[Cannon Group|Herron-Cannon Group]] in 1986.  In 1988, Cannon sold the studios to the leisure and property company [[Brent Walker]] plc and much of the [[backlot]] was sold off and demolished with a [[Tesco]] superstore being built on the land.

[[File:Stage7.jpg|thumb|left|alt=.|The Elstree Studios facility hosts some historic soundstages.]]
[[File:Elstree Studios Block.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sound stages at Elstree Studios.|Stages at Elstree Studios.]]
A "Save Our Studios" campaign was launched in 1988 by managing director, Andrew Mitchell, local Town Councillor and studio historian Paul Welsh, with the support of many film actors and the general public. [[Hertsmere]] Borough Council stepped in and bought the remaining facilities in February 1996 and appointed a management company, Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd., to run the studios in 2000. The purchase ended an eight-year struggle that was due to have culminated in [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] action. Brent Walker's offer to sell the site to the Council, for an undisclosed sum (but no more than its worth as a film studio), represented a victory for the local authority in upholding the planning agreements that protected the studios.

The studios are now most commonly known for being the home of ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' and the [[Big Brother UK]] house (previously at [[Three Mills Studios]] in [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[East End of London|East London]]). The ''Big Brother'' house was actually built on top of the studios' old underwater stage where scenes in ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) and ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby-Dick]]'' (1956) were filmed. Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd's lease expired at the end of March 2007.

It was announced in 2012 that the studios would be the temporary home of [[BBC Studios and Post Production]] during the redevelopment of [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Bickerton |url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/BBC-Studios-and-Post-Production-to-relocate-to-Elstree-Studios_nid-1892.html |title=News &amp; Comments |publisher=Televisual |date=7 August 2012 |access-date=21 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shows such as ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and ''[[Pointless]]'' were based on the site from spring 2013. The original plan was for the BBC to move back to refurbished Television Centre studios in 2015, however due to delays in the broader redevelopment of the old Television Centre site in July 2014, the lease was extended until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28341537 |title=Television Centre return delayed by two years |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=17 July 2014 |access-date=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elstree Studios are now operated by Elstree Film Studios Ltd, a company controlled by Hertsmere Borough Council. Feature film production continues alongside television production, commercials and pop promos; recent productions include ''44" Chest'', ''Bright Star'', ''1408'', ''[[Son of Rambow]]'', ''Amazing Grace'', ''The Other Boleyn Girl'', ''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]'', ''Breaking and Entering'', ''Flyboys'', ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' and ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? (UK)|Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old?]]'' for Sky television among many others.

On 25 November 2019 it was announced that Elstree Studios would continue with their partnership with [[BBC Studioworks]] to provide television studio facilities. The arrangement will see the use of stages by the BBC continue until at least March 2024.&lt;ref&gt;https://bbcstudioworks.com/news/bbc-studioworks-extends-elstree-studios-partnership/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ricinus vaderi''''' is a [[species]] of [[chewing louse|chewing lice]] which parasitises the [[calandra lark]] (''Melanocorypha calandra'') in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="ValanSychra2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valan|first1=Miroslav|last2=Sychra|first2=Oldrich|last3=Literak|first3=Ivan|title=Chewing lice of genus ''Ricinus'' (Phthiraptera, Ricinidae) deposited at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russia, with description of a new species|journal=Parasite|volume=23|year=2016|pages=7|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2016007|url=http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2016/01/parasite150059/parasite150059.html|pmid=26902646|pmc=4763114}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of ''[[Ricinus (animal)|Ricinus]]'', the largest genus of chewing lice found parasitizing [[Passeriformes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard C.

''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' are American [[media franchise]]s which present alternative scenarios of space adventure. The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing employment and [[entertainment]] for billions of people around the world.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|first=Richard|last=Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
''Star Trek'' was introduced as [[Star Trek: The Original Series|a live-action television series]] in 1966 that lasted three years. ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matt |last=Forbeck|title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Could the Empire kick the Federation's ass? And other galaxy-shaking enigmas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=J1sSa6uBdlQC}}|date=April 18, 2011|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-2577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, ''Star Trek'' grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/18/star-trek-vs-star-wars-the-space-battle-that-will-never-end/|title=Star Trek vs Star Wars: the space battle that will never end|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=July 18, 2016|last1=Robey|first1=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' was introduced as a feature film, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). A novelization titled ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'', based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, ''Star Wars'' quickly grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

==Differences==
''Star Trek'' debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]], but evolved into an idealistic, [[utopia]]n prospect of future human society. Inspired by ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'',&lt;ref name="Simon1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Keller|last=Simon|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|url=https://archive.org/details/trashculturepopu0000simo|url-access=registration|date=November 23, 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92442-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/trashculturepopu0000simo/page/139 139]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Clark|title=Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_lxVMh_5xwC&amp;pg=PT22|date=April 1, 2012|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-963-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek''{{'}}s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. ''Star Trek'' occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] and [[Multiverse|interdimensional travel]]. The [[Earth in science fiction|Earth of the ''Star Trek'']] universe shares most of its history with the real world.

''Star Wars'' debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. ''Star Wars'' mainly belongs to the [[space opera]] [[subgenre]] of science fiction that follows [[The Hero's Journey]]&lt;ref&gt;Clive Williams, The Hero’s Journey: A Mudmap for Change, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, (002216781770549), (2017).
Crossref&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]], [[King Arthur]]&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. ''Star Wars'' Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucasfilm|title=Star Wars and History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=m81Bg4E_y_IC}}|date=October 15, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-28525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. ''Star Wars'' is set "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", although many characters are human, occasionally use [[Earth]] metaphors and exhibit human character traits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. ''Star Trek'' has not produced any [[television film]]s; whereas ''Star Wars'' has produced at least three live-action television films outside the ''Star Wars'' film saga. The ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' are all live-action television spin-off films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but not considered part of the official ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars canon]]''.

===Runtime===
* ~513 hours (''Star Trek'' television) + ~25 hours (''Star Trek'' films)
* ~84 hours (''Star Wars'' films) + ''Star Wars'' canon series + expanded universe films and TV productions.

==Similarities and commonalities==
Aside from both having the word ''star'' in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the [[space western]] subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kipen |first1=David |title=Planet Hollywood: The Death of the American Film |journal=World Policy Journal |year=1997 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=60 |jstor=40209531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in ''Star Trek'' consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. ''Star Wars'' depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and was again later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] after a series of wars.

Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages.

The primary philosophies of ''Star Trek'' convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by [[morality play|morality tales]] such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="Simon1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"/&gt; with the basic dramatic format inspired by the science fiction film, ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Rob |title=Forbidden Planet: The Film that Inspired Star Trek Turns 60 |url=https://www.cinelinx.com/movie-news/movie-stuff/forbidden-planet-the-film-that-inspired-star-trek-turns-60/ |website=Cinelinx.com |access-date=2 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary philosophical messages of ''Star Wars'' are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref name="Decker2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin S. |last=Decker|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pDMRdxLocsUC}}|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-0101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' preaches against [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] systems and favors societies that offer equality.&lt;ref name="Redmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sean |last=Redmond|title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ha5O_0BCCrgC|page=303}}|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-87-1|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the ''Star Wars'' 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, [[Patrick Stewart]] stated "A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of ''Star Wars'' is a very very positive one."

There have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''Seaquest''.

Both franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]. Many planets and alien species in ''Star Trek'', for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various ''Star Trek'' television series, such as "[[Who Mourns for Adonais]]", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.&lt;ref name="Kapell2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew Wilhelm |last=Kapell|title=Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hWS7v3pGynUC}}|date=March 1, 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also make references to [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]] and its [[Babylonian religion|mythic folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksarchive.com/viewstory.php?sid=4899|title=Star Trek as Myth Through an Analysis of the Similarities and Differences Between the Gilgamesh/Enkidu and Kirk/Spock Relationships|publisher=The Kirk/Spock fanfiction archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klingon]]s and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/startrek/startrek1.htm|title=Star Trek And the New Myth of the Machine as Seen in the Talosians, Trelane, and the Organians|first=Ken|last=Sanes|publisher=Transparency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Star Wars''{{'}} story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including [[Classical antiquity|classical Greece and Rome]], such as the fall of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] in ''Star Wars'', followed by the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which parallels the fall of the ancient [[Roman Republic]] followed by the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

A 1983 documentary on the making of ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' was hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-2-20/leonard-nimoy-hosts-1983-return-jedi-set-visit-awesome-long-lost-clip|title=Leonard Nimoy hosts 1983 Return of the Jedi set visit in this awesome, long-lost clip|work=Trent Moore|publisher=SyFyWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) was poorly received and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception. The two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.

=== Abrams era ===
{{Main|J. J. Abrams|Sequel trilogy}}
[[J. J. Abrams]] has been heavily involved in both franchises, as director and producer of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and producer of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), and director and producer of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) and ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019). ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] starred in both series. The newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2016/01/star-wars-abu-dhabi-the-worthy-zinzana-rattle-the-cage-justice-1201677541/|title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens Helps Abu Dhabi Build Road To Somewhere|first=Ali|last=Jaafar|magazine=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scenes for cities in the film ''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/star-trek-beyond-descends-on-dubai-jlt-difc-raided-2015-10-13-1.606444|title='Star Trek Beyond' descends on Dubai: JLT, DIFC 'raided'|work=Emirates 24-7|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite J.J. Abrams' ''Trek'' and ''Wars'' entries being financial and critical success with critics, the original filmmakers behind both franchises did not feel the same, and criticized J.J. Abrams for doing remakes instead of original plots. ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' ended being considered less original than its Abrams-directed predecessor, and more of a loose [[remake]] of ''Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cranswick |first=Amie |url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/11/the-wrath-of-khan-director-wasnt-impressed-by-star-trek-into-darkness/ |title=The Wrath of Khan director wasn't impressed by Star Trek Into Darkness |publisher=Flickering Myth |date=November 27, 2018 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of ''Wrath of Khan'', Nicholas Meyer, from which ''Into Darkness'' borrowed lines and plot elements, revealed in 2018, to have been disappointed with the film, saying: "In my sort of artistic worldview, if you’re going to do an homage, you have to add something. You have to put another layer on it, and they didn’t. Just by putting the same words in different characters’ mouths didn't add up to anything, and if you have someone dying in one scene and sort of being resurrected immediately after there's no real drama going on. It just becomes a gimmick or gimmicky, and that's what I found it to be ultimately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/wrath-khan-director-disappointed-star-trek-into-darkness/|title=Wrath of Khan Director Disappointed by Star Trek Into Darkness|date=November 25, 2018 |work=ScreenRant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] shared a similar disappointment towards Abrams's ''[[Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens-10-ways-its-a-remake-of-a-new-hope |title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens - 10 Ways It's A Remake Of A New Hope |publisher=Whatculture.com |date=December 18, 2015 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/mapping-star-wars-force-awakens-characters/ |title=The Force Awakens and A New Hope Are More Similar Than You Think |work=Wired |date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding himself agreeing with the critics who found it too derivative of his own original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, particularly his original film. During an interview with talk show host and journalist [[Charlie Rose]] that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a divorce, and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of ''The Force Awakens''. He described the previous six ''Star Wars'' films as his "children" and defended his vision for them, while criticizing ''The Force Awakens'' for having a "retro feel", saying: "I worked very hard to make them completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships – you know, to make it new." Lucas also likened Disney to "white slavers", which drew some criticism, he later apologized for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Child|first1=Ben|title=Attack of the moans: George Lucas hits out at 'retro' Star Wars: The Force Awakens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/george-lucas-attacks-retro-star-wars-the-force-awakens|access-date=April 18, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Jeff|title=George Lucas elaborates on his reaction to 'The Force Awakens'|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865645039/George-Lucas-elaborates-on-his-reaction-to-The-Force-Awakens.html?pg=all|access-date=April 18, 2016|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the batch of new ''Star Wars'' films, the Abrams written and directed films, received the worst reception from Lucas.

Years later critics agreed with Lucas and Meyers criticisms, when Abrams directed and wrote the worst received live-action film in the ''Star Wars'' film franchise, called ''Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker''. Website ''The Ringer'' noted the reception to said film to be so negative, that the film (and it´s tie-ins), kept generating negative or controversial headlines in regards to the film´s production for almost 10 months after it´s release. The film was the one where Abrams had the most creative control.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theringer.com/star-wars/2020/9/11/21431852/rise-of-skywalker-daisy-ridley-john-boyega&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/tv/mandalorian-season-2-first-look/&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Abrams was criticized for doubling down on Meyer´s criticism towards ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', due to the plot killing and instantly resurrecting almost every character in the film. Force powers to revive others, were a central plot of the film, but they lost all meaning due to most resurrections not even anything having to do with such powers, including those of Palpatine, Chewbacca, C-3PO and even the most minor cameo characters Zorry Bliss, and Babu Frik. On his negative review for ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', [[Nicholas Meyer]] had previously criticized J. J. Abrams, for doing fake deaths, were he killed main characters, only to quickly revive them. ''The Rise of Skywalker'' was also criticized for being another derivative remake of a previous film in said franchise, this time of the Lucas written ''Return of the Jedi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/11/the-wrath-of-khan-director-wasnt-impressed-by-star-trek-into-darkness/|title=The Wrath of Khan director wasn't impressed by Star Trek Into Darkness |date=November 27, 2018 |website=Flickering Myth|language=en-US |access-date=June 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://io9.gizmodo.com/lets-talk-about-death-baby-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-1844998633&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theringer.com/star-wars/2020/9/11/21431852/rise-of-skywalker-daisy-ridley-john-boyega&lt;/ref&gt; Websites have defended Johnson's ''VIII: The Last Jedi'', and blamed Abrams and Disney for the failure of ''IX: Rise of Skywalker'', while criticizing Abrams usage of his ¨mystery box¨.&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/star-wars-rise-skywalker-bad-disney-abrams-fault-not-last-jedi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/star-wars-sequel-trilogy-problems-bad-jj-abrams-blame/&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams also was heavilly criticized for white-washing the classic ''Star Trek'' character of [[Khan Noonien Singh]], since Khan is an explicitly non-white character in the [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] (introduced as a [[Sikh]] and former ruler of much of eastern Eurasia).&lt;ref name="Blauvelt, Christian 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/55014633/star-trek-into-darkness-fan-review-betrayal-star-wars-prequels | title=A 'Star Trek Into Darkness' Fan Review: Your 'Star Wars' Prequel Anger Is What I Feel Now | publisher=Hollywood.com | work=2.

One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within ''US'', not some other race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trekmovie.com/2013/05/20/sticky-into-darkness-open-week-thread-polls/#comments |title=Into Darkness Open Week Thread + Polls |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date=May 20, 2013 |access-date=June 3, 2013 |archive-date=November 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118044923/https://trekmovie.com/2013/05/20/sticky-into-darkness-open-week-thread-polls/#comments |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams addressed some of the film's shortcomings. He thought that the dynamic for Kirk and Spock's relationship in the film "wasn’t really clear." For keeping the identity of Khan a secret prior to the film's release, Abrams felt he "was trying to preserve the fun for the audience, and not just tell them something that the characters don’t learn for 45 minutes into the movie, so the audience wouldn’t be so ahead of it." In the end, Abrams recognized that "there were certain things I was unsure of.... Any movie...has a fundamental conversation happening during it. And [for ''Into Darkness'',] I didn’t have it.... [The problems with the plot] was not anyone’s fault but mine, or, frankly, anyone’s problem but mine. [The script] was a little bit of a collection of scenes that were written by my friends.... And yet, I found myself frustrated by my choices, and unable to hang my hat on an undeniable thread of the main story. So then I found myself on that movie basically tap-dancing as well as I could to try and make the sequences as entertaining as possible.... I would never say that I don’t think that the movie ended up working. But I feel like it didn’t work as well as it could have had I made some better decisions before we started shooting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/jj-abrams-and-the-long-road-to-star-wars|title=The Triumphs And Mistakes That Got J.J.

==Estimated financial comparisons==
Despite the similar number of films, the profit made by the ''Star Wars'' film series exceed the profit of the ''Star Trek'' film series by six times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, novels, memorabilia, video games and other factors must be taken into account.

==Critique and commentaries==
Science fiction writer [[David Brin]] criticized ''Star Wars'' at the time of the release of ''The Phantom Menace'', arguing that while the ''Star Wars'' movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with ''Star Wars'' and George Lucas, whom he accused of "having an agenda", is that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy is too "elitist", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the [[Galactic Civil War]] as part of the "same genetically superior royal family".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists|first=David|last=Brin|work=Salon|date=June 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the ''Star Wars'' universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil – for example citing the idea that [[Luke Skywalker]] killing [[Palpatine]] would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives. Among the many other flaws he sees with ''Star Wars'' is that [[Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a hero in the ending of ''Return of the Jedi'' simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, ''Star Trek'' is "democratic" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[William Shatner]] argues that ''Star Trek'' is superior to ''Star Wars''. According to him, "''Star Trek'' had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions". Shatner believes that ''Star Wars'' was only better than ''Star Trek'' in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, ''Star Trek'' was able to "supersede ''Star Wars'' on every level".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/william-shatner-star-trek-star-wars_n_964530.html|title=William Shatner: 'Star Wars Is Derivative Of Star Trek'|first=Gazelle|last=Emami|date=September 15, 2011|newspaper=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Russ]], who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that ''Star Trek'' reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. ''Star Wars'' in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the [[Eastern philosophy]] of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, ''Star Trek'' comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in "our" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas ''Star Wars'' takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] is best known for his role as [[Boba Fett]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. He is a huge fan of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. He argued that while both franchises are popular, ''Star Wars'' comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

Contrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J. C. Herzthe of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued, "''Trek'' fandom revolves around technology because the ''Star Trek'' universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. [[Physics and Star Wars|The science in ''Star Wars'']] is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because ''Star Wars'' isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second [[Death Star]] works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html|title='Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor|date=October 29, 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenzel of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlighted two differences in approach, noting the "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style of ''Star Wars'' compared with ''Star Trek''{{'}}s "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity" and that the spiritual aspect of ''Star Wars'' contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101|title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe|first=John|last=Wenzel|date=October 11, 2009|work=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire [[Peter Thiel]] told Dowd "I'm a capitalist. ''Star Wars'' is the capitalist show. ''Star Trek'' is the communist one". He further stated "There is no money in ''Star Trek'' because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of ''Star Wars'' starts with [[Han Solo]] having this debt that he owes and so the plot in ''Star Wars'' is driven by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/peter-thiel-star-trek-communist-star-wars-capitalist/|title=Peter Thiel Thinks 'Star Trek' Is 'Communist' While 'Star Wars' Is 'Capitalist'|date=January 11, 2017|work=TheWrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archived footage in ''[[Trek Nation]]'' showed [[Gene Roddenberry]] saying, "I like ''Star Wars''. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;''[[Trek Nation]]'' [2010 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on each other==
{{see also|Star Wars sources and analogues}} 
The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits ''Star Wars'' for launching the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name="dominguez19990517"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archive-date=January 12, 2012 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=Daily News|location=New York | date=May 17, 1999 | access-date=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 ''Star Trek'' fan convention in [[Las Vegas]] by stating "''Star Wars'' created ''Star Trek''". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope''), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A ''Star Trek'' relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2016/08/07/william-shatner-says-star-wars-created-star-trek/|title=William Shatner Says Star Wars Created Star Trek|publisher=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was ''Star Wars'' that thrust ''Star Trek'' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" Shatner stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/08/06/media/william-shatner-star-wars-star-trek/index.html|title=Captain Kirk thanks Star Wars!|first=Jose|last=Pagliery|date=August 6, 2016|website=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/star-trek-star-wars-shatner/|title=William Shatner: 'Star Trek' owes a big thanks to 'Star Wars'|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; He explained that while both franchises were so "far out", ''Star Trek'' produced a fanbase that "softened up the entertainment arena" so that ''Star Wars'' could "come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/26348/george-lucas-on-how-star-trek-helped-star-wars|title=George Lucas on how Star Trek helped Star Wars|publisher=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call ''Star Wars'' a "derivative" of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A few references to ''Star Wars'' have been inserted into ''Star Trek'' films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from ''Star Wars'' in both ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/10/star-wars-r2d2-star-trek-into-darkness|title=Star Wars droid R2D2 spotted in Star Trek Into Darkness|last=Child|first=Ben|date=September 10, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Star Trek'' films and television episodes used the ''Star Wars'' animation shop, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], for their special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilm.com/archive/|title=Archive|publisher=Industrial Light &amp; Magic|access-date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roddenberry was honored at a ''Star Trek'' convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as [[Darth Vader]]. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of ''Star Wars'' and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Comic relief==
William Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2013/4/film-exclusive|title=Shatner Honors Lucas|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 at a live concert, Shatner dressed as an [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|imperial stormtrooper]] singing "[[Girl Crush]]" alongside [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Brad Paisley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753087/william-shatner-star-wars-stormtrooper-girl-crush-cmas|title=William Shatner Dresses as 'Star Wars' Stormtrooper, Sings 'Girl Crush' at CMAs|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Shatner and [[Carrie Fisher]] posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

In a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Princess Leia]] eloping and running off into the sunset would be the "perfect union" between ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Shatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his [[Twitter]] account mocking ''Star Wars''. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received ''Star Wars Holiday Special''. It was then that ''Star Wars'' actor [[Peter Mayhew]] posted a "retaliation" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', another poorly received film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/03/22/william-shatner-cant-stop-trolling-star-wars-fans/|title=William Shatner can't stop trolling Star Wars fans|work=The Telegraph}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.

''Star Trek'' was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' reboot]] (2009), which was followed by ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on [[CBS All Access]], an online streaming platform, in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/new-star-trek-series-premieres-january-2017|title=Star Trek New Star Trek Series Premieres January 2017|work=StarTrek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' picked up from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off, with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' the first in the new trilogy, followed by ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' in 2017, and [[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]] in 2019. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', a television series set in between the ''Star Wars'' prequels and the original trilogy, ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', a television series set in between the original trilogy and the ''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone ''Star Wars'' films, starting with ''[[Rogue One]]'', which was released in December 2016, and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' following in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Upcoming-Star-Wars-Movies-List-Titles-Release-Dates-100467.html|title=Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates|date=December 16, 2015|newspaper=CinemaBlend|access-date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan works===
{{further|Star Trek fan productions|Star Wars fan films}}
Aside from official works by the producers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'', many [[fan film]]s and [[webisode]]s set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in relation to either franchise.

      <text bytes="4149" xml:space="preserve">The '''Death Star''' strategy (named after the [[Death Star]] space station and weapon from the movie ''[[Star Wars]]'') was the name [[Enron]] gave to their practice of shuffling energy around the [[California]] [[power grid]] to receive payments from the state for "relieving congestion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1020718637382274400|title=New Documents Show Enron Traders Manipulated California Energy Costs|first=Kathryn|last=Kranhold |author2=Bryan Lee |author3=Mitchel Benson|date=2002-05-07|access-date=2008-08-21|work=Free Preview|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company's own memo they would be paid "for moving energy to relieve congestion, without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion."

For example, if the California power grid was congested with energy flowing south, Enron would schedule energy to be transmitted north to [[Oregon]]. They would receive a payment from California for apparently relieving congestion on the grid. Then Enron would schedule the energy to be transferred back to its point of origin, but not through California. Ultimately the energy would end up right back where it started, and Enron would be paid by California without actually putting any electricity on their grid.

The firm acknowledged in internal documents the inherent ethical dilemmas, in one internal document stating "Traders could buy power at $250 and sell it for $1,200. Doing so appears not to present any problems, other than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2 Emergency yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/08/business/enron-s-many-strands-strategies-enron-got-california-buy-power-it-didn-t-need.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar business practices by Enron==
Enron used a number of other named fraudulent business practices in the years leading to its collapse. Most prominent among them:
* "Fat Boy": This scam (aka "Inc-ing") also involved overscheduling power transmission &amp;ndash; for example, to a company subsidiary that did not really need all of it. Then Enron would sell the "excess" power to the state at a premium.
* "Ricochet": Also called "megawatt-laundering" (by analogy to [[money laundering]]), Ricochet was the power equivalent of a [[flipping|land flip]]: buy in-state power cheaply, flip it out-of-state to an intermediary, then re-sell it to California at a highly inflated "imported" price.
* "Black Widow": Enron intentionally introduced errors to potentially money-losing transactions and would use those errors to invalidate transactions if they lost money.&lt;ref name= mresearch&gt;http://www.mresearch.com/pdfs/19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Bigfoot": Enron introduced low electricity bids but signed them as a competitor, depressing energy prices to enable low-priced Enron purchases.&lt;ref name="mresearch" /&gt;
* "Get Shorty": Enron sold electricity it did not own, depressed demand, then purchased back the notional electricity at lowered prices.

John Forney, a former energy trader who invented various strategies such as the "Death Star," was indicted in December 2002 on 11 counts of conspiracy and wire fraud. His supervisors, [[Timothy Belden]] and Jeffrey Richter, both pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and assisted prosecutors. On August 5, 2004, Forney pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was given two years probation and a $4,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/16/national/main623569.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Former Enron Trader Pleads Guilty | date=2004-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/4654411.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Xenokeryx''''' ("strange horn" in Greek) is an extinct genus of [[Ruminantia|ruminant]] known from the [[Miocene]] of Europe. The type species, '''''Xenokeryx amidalae''''', was recovered from central Spain and bears a unique T-shaped protrusion from the top of the head.

      <text bytes="23087" xml:space="preserve">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Journey to ''Star Wars''}}
"'''Journey to ''Star Wars'''''" is a [[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]/[[Lucasfilm]] publishing initiative that connects the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel films]] with previous film installments in the franchise. It currently includes the initiatives "'''Journey to ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'''''" and "'''Journey to ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'''''", and "'''Journey to ''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker'''''". All titles under the program are canonical to the
''Star Wars'' universe.

A group of "at least" 20 novels and comic books related to the 2015 film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' was announced in March 2015. The first novels, including ''[[Star Wars: Aftermath]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Lost Stars]]'',

[[Image:Opening crawl.jpg|thumb|300px|Three [[Film frame|frames]] representative of opening sequences from films in the [[Skywalker Saga]]. The phrase "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...." which remains static on the screen and the ''Star Wars'' logo which shrinks to a central point is common to all of the films and are followed by a film-specific opening crawl.  The example shown comes from a post-1981 re-release as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''.]]
The '''''Star Wars'' opening crawl''' is a signature device of the opening sequences of every numbered film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. Within a black sky background featuring a smattering of stars, the crawl is preceded both by the static blue text, '''"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."''' and by the ''Star Wars'' logo which recedes toward a central point on the screen before disappearing.  The crawl text, which describes the [[backstory]] and context of the film, then recedes toward a higher point in relation to the screen and with an apparent effect of disappearing in the distance. The visuals are accompanied by the "[[Star Wars Theme|Main Title Theme]]", composed by [[John Williams]].

This sequence has featured at the beginning of each of the main ''Star Wars'' saga theatrical films produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series.{{explain|date=March 2020}} It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.

The opening crawl was not used in the animated film [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|'' Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] or in the ''Star Wars'' "Anthology" films, ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|'' Solo'']], although all three films begin with the opening text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....". Additionally, the opening sequence of ''Solo'' continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text, while ''The Clone Wars'' uses a narrator to provide exposition in a similar style to a [[newsreel]].

==Structure==
Each film opens with the static blue text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....", followed by the ''Star Wars'' [[logo]] shrinking in front of a field of stars, as if moving away from the viewer. Initially, the logo's extremities are beyond the edge of the frame. While the logo is retreating, the "crawl" text begins, starting with the film's episode number and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] (with the exception of the original release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&amp;nbsp;– [[Star Wars opening crawl#Episode IV opening crawl|see below]]), and followed by a three-paragraph prologue to the film. The text scrolls up and away from the bottom of the screen towards a [[vanishing point]] above the top of the frame in a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projection. Each version of the opening crawl ends with a four-dot [[ellipsis]], except for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' which has a three-dot ellipsis. When the text has nearly reached the vanishing point, it fades out, the camera [[Tilt (camera)|tilts]] down (or, in the case of ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones'', up), and the film begins.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Several words are in all-capital letters to stress their importance: "[[Death Star|DEATH STAR]]" in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', "[[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|GALACTIC EMPIRE]]" in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', "[[Clone trooper|ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC]]" in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]", "[[New Republic (Star Wars)|REPUBLIC]]" and "[[Resistance (Star Wars)|RESISTANCE]]" in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]" and "[[Resistance (Star Wars)|RESISTANCE]]" again in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', and "[[Revenge|REVENGE]]", "[[Palpatine|EMPEROR PALPATINE]]", "[[Princess Leia|GENERAL LEIA ORGANA]]", "[[Rey (Star Wars)|REY]]", "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]", and "[[Kylo Ren|KYLO REN]]" in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''. Each line of the text spans the width of the screen when it enters from the bottom. In the [[Pan and scan|"fullscreen"]] (4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] for standard-definition television) versions of the films, the full lines of text are cut off on the sides until they have scrolled further onto the screen.  As a result, by the time the full lines are visible, the text is much smaller and harder to read.  In addition, the viewer also has less time to read it.

==Origin==
[[File: Flash Gordon (1940) - Opening Crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl as seen at the beginning of an episode of ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''.]]
[[File: Union Pacific opening crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl of Cecil B. DeMille's ''Union Pacific'' (1939)]]
[[File:Star wars 1977 us.svg|thumb|Dan Perri's rejected ''Star Wars'' logotype]]
Lucas has stated that the opening crawl was inspired by the opening crawls used at the beginning of each episode of the original ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' film serials, which were the inspiration for Lucas to write much of the ''Star Wars'' saga.&lt;ref name="EpIII Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the opening crawl came about as part of a collaboration between Lucas and the seasoned film title designer [[Dan Perri]]. In 1976, Lucas invited Perri to [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], Lucasfilm's post-production operation at [[Van Nuys]], California. Perri, who had previously worked on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', suggested that they take inspiration from the 1939 [[Cecil B. DeMille]] film, ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'', whose opening credits are shown distorted by a sharp perspective and rolling along a [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] towards a distant [[vanishing point]].&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|date=16 December 2015|title=Star Wars|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074725/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|archive-date=2 April 2016|access-date=8 June 2016|website=Art of the Title}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811100417/http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|archive-date=11 August 2017|access-date=11 August 2017|website=[[Art of the Title]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas was keen on the idea, so Perri developed sketches and prototype mechanical artwork. One of the earliest iterations of the opening crawl is evidenced in [[storyboard]]s drawn by the production artist [[Alex Tavoularis]], depicting the title “THE STAR WARS” as a three-dimensional logo.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Star Wars|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|website=Art of the Title|access-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074725/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|archive-date=2 April 2016|date=16 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perri also designed a [[logotype]], consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl. Lucas eventually rejected Perri's logo due to readability problems, turning instead to the graphic designer [[Suzy Rice]], an art director at the [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising agency]] [[Seiniger Advertising]]. Lucas had commissioned Rice to design a promotional brochure that was to be distributed to cinema theatre owners. He instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear "very [[fascism|fascist]]" in style. Rice, inspired by historical German [[typography]], produced a bold logotype using an outlined, modified [[Helvetica|Helvetica Black]]. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the ''S'' and ''T'' of ''STAR'' and the ''R'' and ''S'' of ''WARS''. Lucas's producer, [[Gary Kurtz]], found that Rice's logo worked well in the opening title; the logo was modified further to flatten the pointed tips on the letter ''W'' before it was inserted into the final cut. While Perri's skewed logo did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising, and it featured prominently on [[film poster]]s promoting the release of ''Star Wars'' on cinema billboards in 1977 (notably [[Tom Jung]]'s ''[[: File:StarWarsMoviePoster1977.jpg|Style ‘A’ poster]]'', the [[:File: Bros Hildebrandt Star Wars quad poster.jpg|''Style ‘B’'' poster]] by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and [[Tom Chantrell]]'s [[:File: Tom Chantrell Star Wars quad poster 1977.jpg|'' Style ‘C’'' poster]]).&lt;ref name="taylor-logo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|date=2014|publisher=Head of Zeus|isbn=9781784970451|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7GbBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=suzy%20rice%20star%20wars%20logo&amp;pg=PT185 |access-date=1 June 2016|chapter=11.

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas described how the final phrasing of the text for ''Star Wars'' came about. "The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem. I showed the very first crawl to a bunch of friends of mine in the ’70s. It went on for six paragraphs with four sentences each. [[Brian De Palma]] was there...". De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, Cindy (May 15, 2005). [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050515/ai_n14631916 The Force]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to [[Dennis Muren]], who worked on the first six films, crawls on the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|original trilogy]] films were accomplished by filming physical models laid out on the floor. The models were approximately 60&amp;nbsp;cm (2') wide and 1.80&amp;nbsp;m (6') long. The crawl effect was accomplished by the camera moving longitudinally along the model. It was difficult and time-consuming to achieve a smooth scrolling effect. Furthermore, different versions in other languages (such as German, French and Spanish) were produced by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpIV Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphics]], the crawls for the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] were achieved much more quickly.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;  The 2004 DVD special edition versions of the original trilogy were later updated with computer-generated crawls [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|as part of their restoration and enhancement]].

Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] stated that the 2016 spin-off film ''[[Rogue One]]'' would "more than likely" eschew certain traditional elements of the franchise, including the crawl, in an effort to distinguish it from the main film series.&lt;ref name="polygon-rogueone"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rogue One'' is bucking a ''Star Wars'' tradition|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/22/13718828/rogue-one-star-wars-tradition|first=Julia|last=Alexander|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=Vox Media|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''Rogue One'' retains "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...", but then immediately cuts to the opening scene with no crawl. At the end of the opening scene, the title "ROGUE ONE" recedes against a star field, like the "STAR WARS" title of the main series, then there is a cut to the next scene.

The second spin-off film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' does not feature a crawl, but does feature an introductory text shown sentence by sentence in the same font and color as and immediately after "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/star-wars/feature/a857379/solo-a-star-wars-story-opening-crawl/ Does Solo: A Star Wars Story have an opening crawl?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Episode IV'' opening crawl==
The opening crawl in the first ''Star Wars'' film is very different from Lucas's original intention. The original text, used in the rough cut he showed to friends and studio executives in February 1977, appears in the [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel Comics adaptation of the film]]. When originally released in May 1977, the first film was simply titled ''Star Wars'', as [[20th Century Fox]] forbade Lucas to use a subtitle on grounds that it could be confusing, since there had been no other ''Star Wars'' movies prior to 1977.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpIV Commentary"/&gt; In addition, it was not certain if the film would be followed with a sequel. When ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was released in 1980, the episode number, "Episode V", and subtitle "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" appeared as the first two lines of the opening crawl. To match its sequel's crawl, the episode number "Episode IV" and subtitle "A NEW HOPE" were added for the film's theatrical re-release in April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope|title=Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version, without the subtitle, was not released again until the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2006 Star Wars Trilogy DVD Box Set|2006 limited edition DVDs]]. Also, it should be noticed that the original version of ''Episode IV''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s crawl features a lowercase "R" for "Rebel spaceships" and "Rebel spies", as, at the time, "Rebel" (in its ''Star Wars'' meaning), just like "Imperial", was not considered some sort of [[demonym]]-like adjective as it is now.

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include southern and eastern Asian religions, [[Qigong]], [[philosophy]], [[classical mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Zoroastrianism]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]] and [[Taoism]], and countless cinematic precursors. Creator [[George Lucas]] stated "Most of the spiritual reality in the movie[s] is based on a synthesis of all religions. A synthesis through history; the way man has perceived the unknown and the great mystery and tried to deal with that or dealing with it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Science of Star Wars (miniseries)|Science of Star Wars]] (2005 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also speculated that ''Star Wars'' also takes inspirations from pre-Roman [[Celtic mythology|Celtic folklore]] ([[Arthurian legends]] are post-Roman, set around the third century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/weird-and-wonderful/celtic-myths-tales-might-have-inspired-star-wars-and-harry-potter|title=Celtic myths: the tales that might have inspired ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter''|work=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has also said that [[chivalry]], [[knighthood]], [[paladin]]ism and related institutions in [[Feudalism|feudal societies]] inspired some concepts in the ''Star Wars'' movies, most notably the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]]. The work of the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', directly influenced Lucas,&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy |date=2004 |medium=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is what drove him to create the "modern myth" of ''Star Wars''. The natural flow of energy known as [[the Force]] is believed to have originated from the concept of ''[[qi|qi/chi/ki]]'', "the all-pervading vital energy of the universe".

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of ''Star Wars'', [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] premiered a two-hour event covering the entire ''Star Wars'' saga entitled ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]].'' Featuring interviews from the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Peter Jackson]], acclaimed [[scholar]]s and others, the program delved further into the [[Hero]]ic Epic concept and the influences of mythology and other motifs that were important in making ''Star Wars''. Subjects include [[Ancestral sin|sins of the father]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redeeming the father]], [[coming of age]], exiting the ordinary world and others.

* The science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] stated on several occasions that George Lucas's galaxy-wide [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov's [[Foundation Series]]. The greatest differences are that Asimov's Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga's later volumes, most notably ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. Since Asimov's death in 1992, the ''Star Wars'' cinematic universe has gained new Asimovesque elements: ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' introduced the planet [[Coruscant]], which bears a close resemblance to Asimov's [[Trantor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* ''Star Wars'' borrows significantly from [[Arthurian mythology]]; especially with respect to plot and main character development. The life and character development of [[Luke Skywalker]] resembles that of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Both are orphans who later become heroes in their early adulthood.

The script for ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'' was circulating in Hollywood at the time of Lucas' early work on ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html|title=Star Wars Origins - Frank Herbert's Dune|work=moongadget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/05/20/how-dune-almost-prevented-star-wars-from-ever-being/|title=How 'Dune' almost prevented 'Star Wars' from ever being|first=Chris|last=Kensler|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/q-a-jodorowskys-dune-explores-690348|title=Q&amp;A: 'Jodorowsky's Dune' Explores the Unmade Space Epic That Paved the Way for 'Star Wars'|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many Chinese fans{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} of the franchise believe the characters and plot of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy to be directly analogous to [[Jin Yong]]'s [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]''. Supporting this theory, the mythical concept of the Force bears striking resemblance to the concepts of internal energy and qi, which form a primary element in traditional wuxia literature. Other arguments may include the clothing style in the Star Wars movies being similar to that in the early adaptations of Jin Yong's novels, as well as the similarity in the main leads' motivation and relationship.

====Pulp heroes and comics====
*[[Buck Rogers]], another hero from pulp magazines from 1920s, and late comic strips (1929–67) and later a [[Buck Rogers (serial)|1939 film serial]] and a 1950–51 TV series. ''Star Wars'' also influenced from its [[Trope (literature)|tropes]].&lt;ref name="Dreams"/&gt;
[[File:Poster - Flash Gordon (Chapter 13, Rocketing to Earth) 03.jpg|thumb|The classic science fiction film serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' served as an inspiration for ''Star Wars''.]]
*[[Flash Gordon]] is the pulp-hero whose original property which George Lucas had sought to license before making the first ''Star Wars'' film, ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' includes many elements derived from the 1936 Universal serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''. The basic plot involving the infiltration of a megalomaniacal outer-space Emperor's fortress by two heroes disguised in uniforms of soldiers of his army is drawn from ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'', with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo filling the roles of [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Prince Barin]], respectively, and [[Ming the Merciless]] the Emperor. The Emperor's deadly, hostile planet (the [[Death Star]]/[[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]]), a sometimes scantily-clad brunette space Princess whom the hero defends ([[Princess Leia]]/[[Princess Aura]]), a big, strong, hairy, animal-like ally ([[Chewbacca]]/[[Prince Thun]] of the Lion Men), a fearsome monster found underground and/or fought in an arena by the hero (the Rancor/the Gocko or Orangopoid), a city in the sky ruled by someone who originally works with the villains but later joins the heroes ([[Lando Calrissian]] of Cloud City), ray-guns, and dogfighting spaceships were all elements retained from the first Universal Flash Gordon serial. The opening text crawl of Star Wars is in the same style as the text openings of each chapter of the ''Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe'' serial.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* Lucas mentioned that he read the American translation of ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'', a German science-fiction [[pulp novel]] series in the late 1960s and early 1970s and considers the series to be an "inspiration, less strong than Flash Gordon, but it influenced the design of many starships of ''Star Wars''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKLlUnyG4IQC&amp;pg=PA342 |title=Der deutsche Zukunftsroman 1918-1945: Gattungstypologie und ... - Dina Brandt - Google Books |date= 2012-02-14|access-date=2014-08-05|isbn=9783110947397 |last1=Brandt |first1=Dina }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/aus-aller-welt/science-fiction-serie-aus-rastatt-soll-verfilmt-werden-perry-rhodan-fordert-darth-vader-zum-duell-seite-2/2504942-2.html |title=Science-Fiction-Serie aus Rastatt soll verfilmt werden: Perry Rhodan fordert Darth Vader zum Duell - Seite 2 - Aus aller Welt - Panorama |language=de |publisher=Handelsblatt |access-date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[DC comics]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. There has been a long debate among fans about the influence that [[comic book]] writer [[Jack Kirby]] had on the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/dynamics/2010/12/18/kirby-lucas-and-campbell/|title=Kirby, Lucas, and Campbell|work=Kirby Dynamics|first = Rob|last = Steibel|date = 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's time at [[DC Comics]] between [[Jack Kirby#DC Comics and the Fourth World saga|1971 and 1975]] was defined by his creation of the [[New Gods]] saga. This [[Intergalactic space|intergalactic]] story involved the New God, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] of the planet [[New Genesis]], being prophesied by the [[Source (comics)|Source]] as the warrior to defeat [[Darkseid]] - the tyrannical ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], and, by doing so, bring peace to the universe and end the conflict between the two planets. Unknown to Orion was that he was the son of the evil Darkseid. Parallels can thus be drawn between the nature of the relationships between Orion and Darkseid to Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, as well as between the mythical Source and [[the Force]] . According to some accounts, Lucas met comic book writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] at a dinner in 1972, during which Lucas described the plot of ''Star Wars'', to which Thomas noticed the similarity between this and Kirby's New Gods, which was then already a published series. John Williams who made the iconic ''Star Wars'' soundtracks since 1977, also did the soundtrack for the first ''Superman'' movie in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ro|first=Ronin|title=Tales To Astonish : Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=1-58234-345-4|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]]- Lucas original trilogy co-writer [[Lawrence Kasdan]] noted that the spin-offs were expanding the franchise into more of a [[shared universe]]. Far beyond the previously linear saga, adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises. Kasdan also contrasted ''Star Wars'' to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], noting that ''Star Wars'' features less [[comedy]] than the latter, and adding that he felt a more comedic approach like Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' would "not be ''Star Wars''" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/star-wars-franchise-humor-tone-1201965443/|title='Star Wars': Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan on Why the Franchise Isn't Ready for a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Tone|first1=Kate|last1=Erbland|date=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cinematic-universe-why-is-it-one-works-1096504|title=Can Anyone Besides Marvel Make a Cinematic Universe Work?|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The post-George Lucas film, ''The Rise of Skywalker'' (2019), which was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, has received negative comparisons due to some perceiving it too similar to the ending of ''[[Avengers Endgame]]''. This similarities include the arrival of a fleet led by Lando/Black Panther,  with multiple revived characters, and the main villain and hero, saying "I am", before killing the villain's by disintegrating him. Some perceive this as a negative consequence of Disney owning both franchises.&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/star-wars-game-thrones-worse-ending-comparison/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theringer.com/game-of-thrones/2020/5/19/21262457/game-of-thrones-the-rise-of-skywalker-and-the-challenges-of-modern-fandom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/rise-skywalker-avengers-endgame-final-battle-copy-bad/&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams was criticized for the amount of characters he killed and instantly resurrected.

====[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''====
{{Main|Themes of The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings: film versus book}}
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novels from the 1940´s inspired George Lucas creation of ''Star Wars'' in 76, and in the 2000´s when Tolkien's works were phostomously adapted to film, director [[Peter Jackson]] was in turn influenced by ''Star Wars'' when making  ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' trilogies, which are contemporary to Lucas own prequel trilogy. As such the movies based on Tolkien´s book inspired ''Star Wars'' again, and the inspiration between both franchises became back and forth, from that point on. The sword man [[Bob Anderson (fencer)]], also trained the sword fighters on both sagas. According to the ''Star Wars'' website, The way that Tolkien´s Middle Earth novels and phostomous film adaptations, influenced the  films include:&lt;ref name="starwars.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Bryan |title=The Cinema Behind Star Wars: The Lord of the Rings |url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-the-lord-of-the-rings |website=Star Wars |date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'':
**''[[Fellowship of The Ring]]'', the first book of ''The Lord of the Rings'' has been compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to ''A New Hope''. Like Frodo who was adopted and raised by his uncle Bilbo, Luke was adopted and raised by his step-uncle and aunt Owen and Beru Lars. The passage in which Frodo and the hobbits meet Aragon for the first time in the "[[Prancing Pony]]" bar, is compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to Luke and Obi-wan's first meeting with [[Han Solo]] and Chewbacca in [[Mos Eisley Cantina]]. With Chewbacca being compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to elf Legolas due to his long life-span, and main weapon of choice, which is a bow-caster to Legolas' bow (although Chewbacca is an alien Wookiee who can't speak English, and unlike Elves, his race has suffered slavery, rather than being the dominating race). The scene where the heroes are trapped in the belly of the Death Star and must make a daring escape is strongly inspired by the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Mines of Moria]] chapters. The group is unwillingly drawn down an alternative path when they discover the traditional safe route is destroyed by the enemy. The group is attacked by a tentacled monster and pursued by a resident army (Orcs in Tolkien's novel, Stormtroopers in the film). Obi-wan´s realization of the destruction of planet Alderaan (and Luke's realizing his uncle's death previously during the film), could be compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to Gimli's realization of the death of his cousin and the rest of the dwarves of Moria (although the destruction of Alderaan itself would be more comparable to the destruction of [[Numenor]], due to being an entire continent that gets sunk in the sea in a way that has been compared to the Middle Earth´s equivalent of the [[Atlantis]] myth, but Sauron´s role in that happens thousands of years before most of the other characters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were born). Looking for an exit from the Death Star/ Mines of Moria, the group only manages to escape after the old wizard (Obi-wan in ''Star Wars'', Gandalf in ''The Lord of the Rings'' ) sacrifices his life to an evil monster (the Balrog in Fellowship, and Darth Vader in ''Star Wars'') to buy the rest time to escape. With his last words he yells at his friends to "fly" instead of trying to rescue him. The group does not get time to mourn the Wizard's death, as upon escaping, they are immediately set-upon by a new threat(warg riders in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and TIE fighters in ''Star Wars''). According to ''Star Wars'' website, a draft included Luke speaking a line of dialogue, directly lifted from Tolkien's novels. The respective actors of the Old Wizard characters, Obi-wan and Gandalf, both got Oscar nominations for their roles. While Jackson and Lucas also got Best Picture and directing nominations, for the first film in their respective trilogies.&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mendelson forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mendelson |first1=Scott |title=Box Office: How 'Hobbit' And 'Star Wars' Prequels Overcame Mixed Reviews To Become Monster Hits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/12/01/box-office-how-hobbit-and-star-wars-prequels-overcame-mixed-reviews-to-become-monster-hits/?sh=422d49313c1e |website=Forbes |date=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[The Two Towers]] and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the respective second entries of each franchise, have been noted to portray the military advancement of the antagonists. Additionally in both stories, the ancient wizard returns from his death to keep helping the heroes. However, a main difference is that Obi-wan Kenobi only returns as a ghost to provide advice, while Gandalf fully resurrects and evolves from a "Gray Wizard", to a more powerful "White Wizard". Additionally, at the beginning of the film Luke splits up from the rest of the group, like Frodo at the end of "Fellowship of the Ring", with R2-D2, acting as the analogue for Samwise Gamgee. Gollum  has also been cited as an inspiration for the character of Yoda. Luke meets the mysterious Yoda, who also speaks in a strange manner, at a similar point in his journey to Frodo meeting Gollum in The Two Towers. Although Yoda, unlike Gollum, is a heroic selfless character, and  seeks to help Luke achieve his goals of defeating the empire. Lando´s betrayal is comparable to Boromir´s betrayal too (though Boromir's betrayal occurs in the first installment rather than the second).&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt;
**''[[Return of the King]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the third installments of each franchise share a similar title, and also similar finale in which the heroes are assisted to victory by an Army they initially did not know existed (The Ewok Army in ''Jedi'', and The Army of the Dead in ''King'' (although the walking trees Ents from ''The Two Towers'' have also been compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to Ewoks). The real climactic battle is occurring elsewhere with Luke confronting the Emperor and Darth Vader in the Death Star throne room, and in King, and Frodo inside Mount Doom fighting Gollum and himself to destroy the ring. Though, Luke's accepting his place as a Jedi, would be more comparable to Aragorn's acceptance of his place as King. Luke's battle to forgive the sins of his father Anakin becoming Darth Vader, would be comparable to both Aragorn forgiving his great-grandafather Isildur for not destroying the Ring when he could, and Frodo forgiving Bilbo (even though Bilbo was unaware of the Ring's importance).&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt; Jackson´s ''[[Return of the King]]'' won the Oscar for best picture, along another 10 Oscars.&lt;ref name="mendelson forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mendelson |first1=Scott |title=Box Office: How 'Hobbit' And 'Star Wars' Prequels Overcame Mixed Reviews To Become Monster Hits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/12/01/box-office-how-hobbit-and-star-wars-prequels-overcame-mixed-reviews-to-become-monster-hits/?sh=422d49313c1e |website=Forbes |date=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Hobbit'' trilogy of prequels has been compared by Forbes to the prequel trilogy of ''Star Wars'', due to both receiving a similar reception (though the Tolkien books were released in chronological order, the films made ''The Lord of the Rings'' before ''The Hobbit''. Also, ''The Hobbit'' is a single book, adapted into three films. So rather than star by the fourth parth in the way Lucas did, Jackson started his adaptations in the second part of the novels, which at the time he didn´t expect to become the fourth movie).&lt;ref name="mendelson forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mendelson |first1=Scott |title=Box Office: How 'Hobbit' And 'Star Wars' Prequels Overcame Mixed Reviews To Become Monster Hits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/12/01/box-office-how-hobbit-and-star-wars-prequels-overcame-mixed-reviews-to-become-monster-hits/?sh=422d49313c1e |website=Forbes |date=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''Star Wars'' website, Luke and Anakin's character from the ''Star Wars'' original and [[Star Wars prequel trilogy| prequel film]] [[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']] can be compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to that of Bilbo Baggins in ''The'' ''Hobbit.'' Both were shown to be extremely reluctant to leave their home for personal reasons (For Bilbo, his normal life in the Shire and Anakin, his life with his mother, to whom he was emotionally attached to on [[Tatooine]]) until they both gave into their desire for adventure (in Anakin's case to also become a Jedi) and joined their companions who paid them a visit, on their quest. Though the shire is a green land with a decent economy, Tatooine is a desert planet with a poor economy ran by Hutt gangsters.&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt;

According to the ''Star Wars'' website, in regards of characters:
*The duality of the split persona of fallen Jedi, Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader, has been compared{{by whom|date=February 2021}} to that of the hobbit creature Sméagol / Gollum. In both cases the former being the good person, and the later the corrupted one, with both characters acting as tragic figures showing what could happen to the hero should he be corrupted and abandon his cause (Luke Skywalker in ''Star Wars'', and Frodo in ''Lord of the Rings''). Both of their descents to darkness was caused by an external factor in Sméagol's case it was the temptation of possessing the One Ring and for Anakin it was him being tempted by the dark side of the force. However Darth Vader's place as second in command would also give him a role, analogue to white wizard [[Saruman]] being the second of command of ''Lord of the Rings'' main antagonist [[Sauron]] (to which Emperor [[Palpatine]] would be the main antagonist equivalent, even if their backstory is very different). Additionally, Saruman has also been compared[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed|by whom?]] to ''Star Wars'' character [[Count Dooku]], due to both characters being played by [[Christopher Lee]]. Dooku being Darth Vader's predecessor as Palpatine's second in command (which Darth Vader would kill and replace) and furthermore like Saruman, Dooku was formerly on the side of good (Jedi) until he fell to the dark side due to negative circumstances, Lucas sought Christopher Lee due to Saruman's influence on Darth Vader, and his performance as Saruman. Darth Vader can also be compared to Sauron, in that their human forms bear similar names, Anakin Skywalker is written similar to Annator (which is Sauron´s closest physical form to an human). And both characters were reborn as their evil personas due to volcanic places, Darth Vader due to getting lava burns on Mustafar that make him require a cyborg suit to survive for the rest of his life (which hides his humanity), while is due to Sauron forging the Ring of Power on the heat of Mordor´s lava.&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt;
*Additionally ''Star Wars The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'' animated series producer [[Dave Filoni]], inspired the development of [[Ahsoka Tano]] on Gandalf from ''The Lord of the Rings'' novels and films. Andy Serkis appears as Gollum/Sméagol, while he is also Snoke in the sequel trilogy, both via motion capture.&lt;ref name="starwars.com"/&gt;

Both series have received their own "Special Editions", the ones based on Tolkien´s works, greatly expand the run-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ponniah |first1=Gabriel |title=Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings 4K Transfer Ruins The Original Look |url=https://screenrant.com/lord-rings-4k-upgrade-peter-jackson-ruin/ |website=ScreenRant |date=11 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each live-action film of both Sagas, has been nominated to at least an Oscar. Kevin Smith´s ''[[Clerks 2]]'' features characters arguing about which Saga is better.&lt;ref name="mendelson forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mendelson |first1=Scott |title=Box Office: How 'Hobbit' And 'Star Wars' Prequels Overcame Mixed Reviews To Become Monster Hits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/12/01/box-office-how-hobbit-and-star-wars-prequels-overcame-mixed-reviews-to-become-monster-hits/?sh=422d49313c1e |website=Forbes |date=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''A Song of Ice and Fire'' / ''Game of Thrones'' ====
{{Main|Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire}}
George R. Martin´s ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' / ''Game of Thrones'' (1990´s -present) has been compared to ''Star Wars''. Mostly the characters of Luke Skywalker and Jamie Lanyster, due to both being sword-fighters that lose their hands in duels, while being knights sworn to celibacy. And also due to their incestous relationships to their respective sisters, Leia and Cersei (though Luke and Leia were unaware of being brothers, and the Lanysters have children). Both feature mothers who died at child-birth (in books that were written before the release of ''Revenge of the Sith''), and arguably evil fathers (though Luke and Leia weren´t raised by him). Captain Phasma has also been compared as weaker than Briane of Tharth, due to both sharing the same actress. Many people where in both franchises.&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/star-wars-game-thrones-actors-appear-characters/&lt;/ref&gt; Both franchises feature important fights on throne rooms, with Emperor Palpatine´s throne being compared to the Iron Throne.

===Opera===
* ''Star Wars'' is widely considered to resemble [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in themes, plot elements, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|title=Star Wars and Wagner's Ring|date=12 February 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212113647/http://www.trell.org/wagner/starwars.html|archive-date=12 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===

*Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term ''[[jidaigeki]]'' ("period drama", the Japanese genre of samurai films) while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term [[Jedi]] from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wickman |first1=Forrest |title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html |website=Slate |date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanctuary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |title=History of the Jedi &amp; The Jedi Religion |publisher=Jedi Sanctuary |first=Jedi M. |last=Duggan |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190015/http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |archive-date=2007-06-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="docu"&gt;''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]]'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], (May 28, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The costume for Darth Vader was visually inspired by the character "The Lightning" in the [[Republic Pictures]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Fighting Devil Dogs]]''. The Lightning also had an army of white-armored stormtroopers and flew through the sky in a large triangular airship (the "flying wing").
* Darth Vader's need to wear his helmet to breathe recalls the oxygen helmets of the underground-dwelling Muranians in the 1935 Mascot serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'', which are required by the caped Thunder Riders to be able to breathe on the surface.
* ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' features a pod racing action sequence. This entire sequence is inspired by the famous chariot race of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]''. The climactic moment when Sebulba's Pod attaches itself to Anakin's Pod mimics, almost shot for shot, the climactic moment of the scene in ''Ben Hur'' when Messala accidentally locks wheels with Ben Hur. Lines, scenes and themes from Ben-Hur had already previously influenced the Star Wars films. The conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire is comparable to the earlier film's depiction of the historical Roman-Jewish conflict of the time, with an ascendant Roman Empire, represented by Messala, threatening to wipe out the Jewish rebels and send them extinct. The same Chariot sequence also inspired parts of the Endor speeder chase in Return of the Jedi, which also includes a sequence where two speeders accidentally interlock. The film's famous early line "The Emperor is displeased, he wishes Judea be made into a more obedient province!" significantly influenced dialogue in all Original Trilogy Star Wars films, with the first four words, in particular, is frequently directly quoted in relation to Star Wars Emperor Palpatine character.
* Lucas has also cited [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' as references for the style—if not the story—used in the films. A more direct homage to ''Lawrence of Arabia'' occurs in ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'', as Padme and Anakin talk while walking around the Theed palace on [[Naboo]]. It was filmed at the Plaza de España in [[Seville, Spain]], which in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was the site of the British Army headquarters in Cairo, and was shot in an exact manner as the scene in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' where Allenby ([[Jack Hawkins]]) and Dryden ([[Claude Rains]]) discuss whether to give artillery to Lawrence's Arab troops. In the same film, Padme and Anakin also retreat to an estate called Varykino – the name of the Gromeko family estate in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.  (Some{{who|date=May 2011}} also have considered [[Tom Courtenay]]'s Pasha/Strelnikov character from ''Zhivago'' as an inspiration for Anakin/Darth Vader, but the similarities are likely coincidental.) Similarly, the chase sequence with Zam Wesell on Coruscant likely references ''[[Blade Runner]]''; Lucas based many of the Coruscant cityscapes on Los Angeles in 2019. A reference to ''The Searchers'' occurs in ''Star Wars'', when Luke discovers the burning moisture farm, while the Tusken Raiders sequence in ''Attack of the Clones'' recalls the climax of ''The Searchers''. Han's showdown with Greedo in ''Star Wars'' resembles a scene in another John Ford movie, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.
* Lucas is also a fan of [[Sergio Leone]]'s film ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', and according to Leone's biographer, [[Christopher Frayling]], he listened to the score from Leone's film while editing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Many{{who|date=May 2011}} have considered Vader's first appearance in ''A New Hope'' as being an "homage" to the introduction of [[Henry Fonda]]'s villainous Frank in the Leone film.
* The death scene of [[Yoda]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' is taken almost shot-for-shot from the death scene of the similarly mystical High Lama in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (Yoda and the High Lama also both share a diminutive form and odd cadence of speech).
* The attack on the [[Death Star]] in the climax of the film ''A New Hope'' is similar in many respects to the strategy of [[Operation Chastise]] from the 1954 British film, ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.  Rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and drop a single special weapon at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails another run must be made by a different pilot. Some scenes from the ''A New Hope'' climax are similar to those in ''The Dam Busters'' and some of the dialogue is nearly identical in the two films. These scenes are also heavily influenced by the action scenes from the fictional wartime film ''[[633 Squadron]]''. That film's finale shows the squadron's planes flying down a deep [[fjord]] while being fired at along the way by anti-aircraft guns lining its sides. George Lucas has stated in interviews that this sequence inspired the 'trench run' sequence in ''Star Wars''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
*[[Francis Ford Coppola]]- Lucas based the Luke Skywalker Han Solo friendship based on his own friendship with [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. On the prequels, during Anakin's massacre on Mustafar, the slaughter of the Separatist Council and the declaration of the Galactic Empire are reminiscent of the montage of massacres during the christening scene of ''[[The Godfather]]'', a film directed by his friend and mentor [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. They are similar in that the christening of one (the baby and the Empire) with the death of a group of others (the other dons and the Separatists).&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Christianity Today]]|title=Movies Star Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html|access-date=2008-05-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508031043/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html |archive-date = May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Lucas director Rian Johnson inspired one of the final shots of ''[[The Last Jedi]]'' where the Millenium Falcon door closes, on the final scene of ''[[The Godfather]]'' where a door closes on Michael Carleone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Orquiola |first1=John |title=10 Secrets Lucasfilm Just Revealed About The Last Jedi |url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-8-secrets-easter-eggs/ |website=ScreenRant |date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, Lucas wanted the sequel trilogy Luke Skywalker inspired on the cynic Colonel Kurtz from Coppolla´s "Apocalypse Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seddon |first1=Dan |title=George Lucas also planned to kill Luke in his Star Wars sequel trilogy |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a34366993/star-wars-george-lucas-kill-luke-skywalker/ |website=Digital Spy |date=14 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Maschinenmensch]] – the robot in [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' – inspired the look of C-3PO, although the Maschinenmensch is a [[gynoid]] whereas C-3PO has masculine programming.
* [[Ray Harryhausen]] used [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] to create a mechanical owl, Bubo, in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981). Despite Bubo's similarities (Bubo is metallic and expresses by whistling and rotating its head) to the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[R2-D2]] of the 1977 film ''Star Wars'', Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before ''Star Wars'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Tony Dalton]], ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life'', page 270 (London: [[Aurum Press]] Ltd, 2003) {{ISBN|1-85410-940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lucas used the term ''[[the Force]] '' to "echo" its use by cinematographer [[Roman Kroitor]] in ''[[21-87]]'' (1963), in which Kroitor says, "Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God".&lt;ref name="mythologyofsw"&gt;''[[The Mythology of Star Wars]]'' (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/lucas-2/|title=Life After Darth|last=Silberman|first=Steve|date=May 1, 2005|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Akira Kurosawa====
{{Main|Remakes of films by Akira Kurosawa}}

[[Akira Kurosawa]] films:
* ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) {{ndash}} ''A New Hope'' features the exploits of [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], whereas the plot of ''The Hidden Fortress'' is told from the point of view of two bickering peasants.  The two peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are first shown escaping a battle, while C-3PO and R2-D2 are first shown fleeing an attack in ''A New Hope''. Additionally, both films feature a battle-tested General – Rokurota Makabe in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in ''A New Hope'' – who assist a rebellion led by a princess and engage in a duel with a former rival whom they fought years earlier.  Lucas also features many horizontal [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] scene transitions in ''Star Wars'', a technique used thoroughly by Kurosawa in his films. Similarly, the Princess trades places with a slave girl in ''The Hidden Fortress'', with the slave girl acting as a decoy for the real Princess. In ''The Phantom Menace'', [[Queen Amidala]] trades places with one of her handmaidens who acts as a decoy.
* ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) inspired the brawl scene in the Cantina. Its sequel ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962) inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick.&lt;ref name="InspirationsLucas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-wars/10817059/10-films-that-influenced-Star-Wars.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=May 10, 2014|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**"A Fistful of Dollars" which is Sergio Leone´s first film in ''[[The Man with No Name trilogy]]'', is an unofficial remake of the Kurosawa film "Yojimbo", that also inspired George Lucas. Clint Eastwood´s cowboy character without a name, also inspired the post-Lucas created main character of ''The Mandalorian'', and also the Lucas created character [[Cad Bane]] from ''The Clone Wars'' animated series.&lt;ref&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mandalorian-creator-jon-favreau-talks-shows-inspiration-personal/story?id=67023193&lt;/ref&gt; (Though the  episode ''[[Hostage Crisis (Star Wars: The Clone Wars)|Hostage Crisis]]'' that introduced [[Cad Bane]], has the character also inspired on Hans Gruber, the villain of [[Die Hard]], with it´s plot also being a loose remake of the Bruce Willis film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Bryan |title=The Cinema Behind Star Wars: Die Hard |url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-die-hard |website=Star Wars |date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
***''[[Django]]'' another unofficial western remake of ''[[Yojimbo]]'', inspired Lucas on the name of his character [[Jango Fett]].
* ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' (1975), just two years before the first ''Star Wars'' movie, there are two scenes that bear a striking resemblance to scenes in ''Star Wars''. The first is the Captain and Dersu looking out over the horizon, seeing both the setting sun and the rising moon at the same time. This is much like when Luke Skywalker stares out on the sky with binary suns in ''A New Hope''. The other scene is when Dersu and the Captain are suddenly caught in a blizzard, and they have to quickly build a shelter to spend the night, to survive the cold. The Captain collapses from the cold and Dersu has to drag and stuff him into the shelter. This is similar to the scene in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where Han Solo cuts a tauntaun open with Luke's [[lightsaber]] and stuffs the unconscious Luke into it, when they get caught in a blizzard on the snow planet [[Hoth]]. A similar moment using a horse, happens in  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)]]'', than won an Oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio for playing 1700´s frontier man [[Hugh Glass]].
*''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950): On ''[[The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), from post-George Lucas director [[Rian Johnson]]. The [[Rashomon effect]], is described on the part where Rey is told by Luke, a description of how he considered murdering his nephew Ben Solo in his sleep, due to feeling his inevitable fall to the darkside of The Force. Then Solo, who by that point had renamed himself as Kylo Ren and destroyed multiple planets, tells his perspective, which causes Luke to tell a third perspective of the event. All whom cause a reinterpretation of a similar even in ''Return of the Jedi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Bryan |title=How The Last Jedi got Luke Skywalker right |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-the-last-jedi-got-luke-skywalker-right |website=SYFY WIRE |language=en |date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Seven Samurai]]'' also inspired an episode of ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' animated series, and the first ''Star Wars'' comic with an original plot, that wasn't adapted from the film. ''The Mandalorian'' released its ''[[Chapter 4: Sanctuary]]'' has also been compared to ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Bryan |title=The Cinema Behind Star Wars: Seven Samurai |url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-seven-samurai |website=Star Wars |date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====''Star Trek''====
{{Main|Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars}}
[[George Lucas]] claims he became a fan of ''Star Trek'' when [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]] broadcast in the late 1960s which played an influence on the development of ''Star Wars'' in 1977.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} Lucas claimed he also visited ''Star Trek'' conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trek Nation]] (2010 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest similarity comes from post-George Lucas, director [[J. J. Abrams]] who directed 2 films for each franchise and produced 3. First he directed ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013), and produced of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) as well as the previous 2, and later jumped to producing 3 ''Star Wars'', directing ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) and ''[[Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), and producing ''The Last Jedi'' (2017) set between both. ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] appear in both series. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. Except for the Abrams written and directed ''[[Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), which has been the worst received live-action ''[[Star Wars]]'' film on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;https://collider.com/rise-of-skywalker-worst-reviewed-star-wars-movie/&lt;/ref&gt; Marty McFly jokes about being Darth Vader from planet Vulcan in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaYADHcpdng&lt;/ref&gt; 

On both franchises, Abrams has been criticized for the amount of characters he has killed and instantly resurrected as well as for being derivative of the earlier films of each respective franchise. People criticizing him for this include ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] who had disappointment towards Abrams's ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens-10-ways-its-a-remake-of-a-new-hope |title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens - 10 Ways It's A Remake Of A New Hope |publisher=Whatculture.com |date=December 18, 2015 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/mapping-star-wars-force-awakens-characters/ |title=The Force Awakens and A New Hope Are More Similar Than You Think |work=Wired |date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding himself agreeing with the critics who found it too derivative of his own original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, particularly his original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Child|first1=Ben|title=Attack of the moans: George Lucas hits out at 'retro' Star Wars: The Force Awakens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/george-lucas-attacks-retro-star-wars-the-force-awakens|access-date=April 18, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Jeff|title=George Lucas elaborates on his reaction to 'The Force Awakens'|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865645039/George-Lucas-elaborates-on-his-reaction-to-The-Force-Awakens.html?pg=all|access-date=April 18, 2016|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Meyer]], also gave a negative review for J.&amp;nbsp;J. Abrams film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', criticizing for him for similar things, mainly for remaking his own film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', without introducing new ideas. But also for doing fake deaths, killing main characters, only to quickly revive them (mainly undoing the death from Spock on his original film).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/11/the-wrath-of-khan-director-wasnt-impressed-by-star-trek-into-darkness/|title=The Wrath of Khan director wasn't impressed by Star Trek Into Darkness |date=November 27, 2018 |website=Flickering Myth|language=en-US |access-date=June 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams´ ''[[Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019) was later criticized for similar reasons, resurrecting main characters Palpatine, Chewbacca, C-3PO, Rey, Kylo Ren, and even minor characters who were little less than cameos introduced on that same movie.&lt;ref&gt;https://io9.gizmodo.com/lets-talk-about-death-baby-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-1844998633&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theringer.com/star-wars/2020/9/11/21431852/rise-of-skywalker-daisy-ridley-john-boyega&lt;/ref&gt; Websites have defended Rian Johnson's sequel setup in ''VIII: The Last Jedi'', placing all the blame of the failure of ''IX: Rise of Skywalker'' on J.J.

===Ancient and medieval history===
[[File:User-Deevad.png|thumb|330px|A depiction of a science fictional civilization living a [[medieval]] Earth-like existence; a concept that ''Star Wars'' is a major example of.&lt;ref name="Classen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Classen|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – Methods – Trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez_edSWAQGAC&amp;pg=PA862|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-021558-8|page=862}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* Ancient and medieval history play amongst the strongest and significant influences on ''Star Wars'' which reflects ancient Earth history in its settings, including [[Architecture of Star Wars|architectural]], social and hierarchical structures (i.e. the existence of monarchies and empires) as well as story lines which reflect ancient and medieval history. The transformation of the [[Old Republic (Star Wars)|Old Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] parallels that of the [[Roman Republic]] which transformed into the [[Roman Empire]] in the same manner of conspiracy and manipulation. Lucas was quoted as saying: "I love history, so while the psychological basis of ''Star Wars'' is mythological, the political and social bases are historical".&lt;ref name="christopherklein"/&gt;
* Author Nick Jamilla explains that unlike mainstream futuristic stories, with ''Star Wars'', George Lucas ties in science fiction with ancient history, comparing the Jedi to the [[Samurai]] and historical European swordsmanship. He also parallels the spiritual aspects of the Jedi to eastern [[monks]] and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jamilla2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Sord Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23D4YMmdb0C|date=25 June 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5179-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamilla2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Shimmering Sword: Samurai, Western, and Star Wars Sword Fighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmNBAAAACAAJ|year=2002|publisher=NBK Pub.|isbn=978-0-9718796-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Star Wars'' reflects ancient history in its planetary settings. For example, the planet [[Coruscant]] imitates [[Ancient Rome]] as the capital of the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire; whereas [[Tatooine]] (referring to [[Tataouine]] - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet) imitates the ancient [[Middle East]] (specifically the [[Arabian Peninsula]]) and [[North Africa]] in ancient times as being barren desert and sparsely populated (which it still is today to a certain degree).&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Star Wars (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Coruscant and [[Naboo]] are also two of many planets in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy exhibit architecture inspired by those of ancient Greece, Rome and other ancient southern/southeastern European societies.
* In his book ''The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy'', author Tom Henthorne argues that 1970s science fiction movies such as the ''Star Wars'' films and ''[[E.T.]]'' bring back neo-medieval themes at young boys with a masculine tone in his view. He argues the knighthood-type plots give a sense of encouragement to young boys and give girls the image of being their prizes or captives waiting to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;Henthorne, Tom. ''Boys to Men: Medievalism and Masculinity in Star Wars and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial''. The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy (2004): 73-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Samurai]] warriors of [[Japan]] are somewhat parallel to the concept of the Jedi as an elite warrior class specialized in combat and swordsmanship techniques charged with protecting their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]] (2015 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern and early modern history===
The [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] from the movies share a name with the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] [[Stormtroopers (Imperial Germany)|stormtroopers]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Sturmabteilung]] (lit.

Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some [[Uniforms of the German Army (1935–1945)|historical German Army uniforms]] and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps (although the uniforms technically had more basis with the German [[Uhlans]] within the Prussian Empire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-stormtroopers |quote =The exact cut of the uniforms was certainly familiar, but didn’t rely precisely on the dress of the Second World War.

Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire, [[J. J. Abrams]], the director of ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', has said that the First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to [[Argentina]] after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=45203|title=JJ Abrams Spills Details On Kylo Ren|first=James|last=Dyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name "Darth Vader", and replied: "Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's basically Dark Father." (Rolling Stone, June 2, 2005). ''Vader'' is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "father" (the Dutch word is instead pronounced "fah-der"), and the [[German language|German]] word for "father" (''Vater'') is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for ''Star Wars'', the name "Darth Vader" was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/george-lucas-and-the-cult-of-darth-vader-20050602|title=George Lucas and the Cult of Darth Vader|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have noted the strong political analogies in the ''Star Wars'' universe to contemporary American politics. Major analogies include Lucas's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] being seen in the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last1=O'Connor | first1=Michael | title= What are the Politics of 'Star Wars'? | url=http://www.newsweek.com/does-star-wars-endorse-political-republican-democrat-498365 | date= September 14, 2016 | magazine=[[Newsweek]] | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas even said in 2005 that ''Star Wars'' "was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where [[Richard Nixon]] was trying to run for a [second] term, which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-18/features/0505180309_1_star-wars-sith-palpatine | title='Star Wars' inadvertently hits too close to U.S.'s role | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | first=Mark | last=Caro | date=May 18, 2005 | access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was likewise backed up by the 1973 draft for the first movie, then-called ''The Star Wars'', where Lucas specifically mentioned that the theme involved an independent planet named Aquillae that was compared to North Vietnam, and that the Empire was "America 10 years from now",&lt;ref&gt;Rinzler, J.W., ''The Making of Star Wars'', page 7-8, 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chris. ''How Star Wars Conquered the Universe''. p. 87-88, 109-110, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Walter Murch]], who claimed Lucas, after his failure with ''Apocalypse Now'', decided to do ''Star Wars'' as a way to channel the anti-war and pro-Vietcong ideology in a disguised form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film|last = Ondaatje|first = Michael|publisher = Knopf |date =2005|page =70|quote =Originally George Lucas was going to direct ('Apocalypse Now'), so it was a project that George and John [Milius] developed for [American] Zoetrope. That was back in 1969. Then, when Warner Brothers cancelled the funding for Zoetrope, the project was abandoned for a while. After the success of 'American Graffiti' in 1973, George wanted to revive it, but it was still too hot a topic, the [Vietnam] war was still on, and nobody wanted to finance something like that. So George considered his options: What did he really want to say in 'Apocalypse Now?' The message boiled down to the ability of a small group of people to defeat a gigantic power simply by the force of their convictions. And he decided, All right, if it's politically too hot as a contemporary subject, I'll put the essence of the story in outer space and make it happen in a galaxy long ago and far away. The rebel group were the North Vietnamese, and the Empire was the United States. And if you have 'the force,' no matter how small you are, you can defeat the overwhelmingly big power. 'Star Wars' is George's transubstantiated version of 'Apocalypse Now.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian McDiarmid, when recalling something Lucas told him during filming of ''Return of the Jedi'', also implied that the Oval Office, and in particular, Nixon's presidency, played a role in the design of the Emperor's throne room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/nov/07/theatre1 |title=Lindesay Irvine talks to Ian McDiarmid|first=Lindesay|last=Irvine|date=7 November 2005|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political themes in ''[[Rogue One]]'' have also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Somin | first1=Ilya | title=Rogue One and the Politics of Star Wars | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/29/rogue-one-and-the-politics-of-star-wars/ | date=December 29, 2016 | newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last1=Doescher | first1=Ian | title=The Empire Is Us: The Politics of 'Rogue One' | url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/politics-of-rogue-one-214549 | date=December 26, 2016 | magazine=[[Politico Magazine]] | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political and military conflict of the prequel films, especially ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', bears a strong similarity to elements of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865): the [[Galactic Republic]]'s Clone army (officially called the "[[Clone trooper#Grand Army of the Republic|Grand Army of the Republic]]") represents the [[Union Army]] (whose veteran organization was named [[Grand Army of the Republic]]), while the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] mimics the [[Confederate States of America]] (also abbreviated as "the Confederacy").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jamilla |first=Nick |date=2014 |title=Sword Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23D4YMmdb0C&amp;pg=PA153 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |page=153 |isbn=9780786451791 |access-date=12 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~anne/clones.html|title=Attack of the Clones and the Politics of Star Wars|year=2002|last=Lancashire|first=Anne|website=The Dalhousie Review|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zweibrücken Observatory''' ({{lang-de|Volkssternwarte Zweibrücken}}), or the '''Zweibrück Observatory of the Natural Science Association''', is a public observatory in [[Zweibrücken]], Germany. Its dome was painted to resemble the Star Wars character [[R2-D2]] in 2018.

== Construction ==
The observatory is located on a hill in the Zweibrücken campus of the [[University of Applied Sciences, Kaiserslautern]]. In 1999, the Zweibrücken scientific association was founded, with plans to construct an observatory. In 2002 the {{convert|4.57|m|ft}} diameter dome was erected. The construction was an initiative of Professor [[Peter Pokrowsky]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The dome houses a [[Celestron]] C14 optical telescope, with a diameter of {{convert|14|in|cm}}, as well as a [[Coronado SolarMax]] solar telescope with a diameter of {{convert|4|cm|in}} and a focal length of {{convert|40|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="instrumentation" /&gt;

== R2-D2 ==
In September 2018, the telescope dome was painted to resemble the [[R2-D2]] robot from Star Wars by a team led by [[Hubert Zitt]]. It was the second observatory dome to be painted in such a way, following from [[Goodsell Observatory]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="R2D2_panda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R2D2_scienceenthusiast" /&gt; The repainting took 120 man-hours.&lt;ref name="zett" /&gt; It gained internet fame after a post on [[Twitter]] by Star Wars actor [[Mark Hamill]].&lt;ref name="HamillTweet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R2D2_panda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R2D2_scienceenthusiast" /&gt;

[[File:SWC4 - Costume Pageant- Commander Cody (514412052).jpg|thumb|A fan cosplaying [[clone trooper]] Commander Cody. Clone troopers are the primary [[Galactic Republic]] foot-soldiers during the Clone Wars.]]
The '''Clone Wars''' are a series of fictional conflicts in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise by [[George Lucas]]. Though mentioned briefly in [[Star Wars (film)|the first ''Star Wars'' film]] (''A New Hope'', 1977), the war itself was not depicted until ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). The Clone Wars are also the setting for three eponymous projects: [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|a 2D animated series]] (2003–2005), [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|a CGI film]] (2008), and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|a 3D CGI series]] (2008–2014, 2020). They have featured in numerous ''Star Wars'' books and games.

Within the ''Star Wars'' narrative, the Clone Wars involve a three-year war fought to prevent thousands of planetary systems from seceding from the [[Galactic Republic]] and forming the "Confederacy of Independent Systems", often referred to as "the Separatists". The Republic uses an army of [[clone trooper]]s, the namesake of the conflict, led by the [[Jedi Order]] against the Separatist [[battle droid]] army. The conflict was manufactured as a scheme for the Republic's Supreme Chancellor [[Palpatine]], secretly an evil [[Sith]] lord, to gain power and ultimately to convert the democratic Galactic Republic into the [[autocratic]] [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which was controlled through means of a [[military–industrial complex]] and featured in the [[original trilogy]].

Lucas used the Clone Wars narrative to answer questions about the original trilogy, such as how the Empire originated and how Anakin Skywalker became [[Darth Vader]]. The political and military events of the Clone Wars draw inspiration from real-world conflicts and historical events, such as the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[World War II]] and the [[American Civil War]].

== Concept and development ==
The first reference to the Clone Wars is in ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]]' third draft of [[Star Wars (film)|the first film]], which mentions the grizzled cyborg General Kenobi's "diary of the Clone Wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wars were mentioned twice briefly in the final version of the film, referring to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as a general who served [[Leia Organa]]'s father during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/clonewars/about/whatarecw.html|title = What are the Clone Wars?|access-date = December 9, 2015|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[LucasFilm]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717014316/http://www.starwars.com/clonewars/about/whatarecw.html|archive-date = July 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drafting ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), Lucas considered introducing a clone character who had been involved with the Clone Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leigh Brackett]]'s first draft of the film initially developed [[Lando Calrissian]] as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in ''A New Hope'' and were nearly made extinct by the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bouzereau|first= Laurent|year= 1997|title= Star Wars: The Annotated History|publisher= [[Ballantine Books]]|isbn= 978-0345409812|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boba Fett]] was also considered as from a group of [[shock troops|shocktroopers]] nearly wiped out by [[Jedi]] during the Clone Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation no brackets|Kaminski|2007|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these concepts were not included in the final version of the film. Lucas was more guarded about the details of the Clone Wars than any other element of ''Star Wars'',&lt;ref name="taylor124"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; even making them off-limits to licensed products and books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|pp=288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has noted that [[Palpatine]]'s rise to power is similar to that of [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]]; as [[Chancellor of Germany]], the latter was granted "[[Enabling Act of 1933|emergency powers]]", as is Palpatine.&lt;ref name = "DVDcom"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett, [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas has also said that one of the primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars, and all of ''Star Wars,'' was the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Watergate scandal]] era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action.&lt;ref name="commondreams.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/wars-raises-questions-on-us-policy/|title='Wars' Raises Questions on US Policy|first=David|date=May 16, 2005|agency=Associated Press|last=Germain|access-date=June 30, 2016|website=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|publisher=Backstage, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/16/cannes.starwars/|title=Lucas on Iraq war, 'Star Wars'|date=May 16, 2005|publisher=CNN|first=Chris|last=Burns|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Lucas said:

{{quote|All democracies turn into dictatorships—but not by coup. The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon]] or Adolf Hitler. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea. What kinds of things push people and institutions in this direction? That's the issue I've been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire? ...

The clone forces shown at the conclusion of ''Attack of the Clones'' comprised the largest digital army created for a film at that point.&lt;ref name="taylor338"/&gt; Lucas proposed to concept artists that ''Revenge of the Sith'' would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rinzler|2005|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas then radically re-organized the plot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rinzler|2005|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on [[Anakin Skywalker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation no brackets|Kaminski|2007|pp=380–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the "seven battles on seven planets" in part led to Lucas's decision to launch the CGI-animated ''Clone Wars'' television series; Lucas said the cartoon could "do better" at depicting the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction ==
The Clone Wars was first depicted in ''Attack of the Clones'', the release of which brought an end to Lucas's embargo on licensed material set during the era. Numerous novels, comic books, and video games exploring the conflict have been sanctioned by Lucas Licensing.

=== Film ===
''Attack of the Clones'', set at the beginning of the wars, opens with the [[Galactic Republic]]'s rising concern about the secession of thousands of star systems to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which is led by [[Count Dooku]]. Chancellor Palpatine manipulates [[Jar Jar Binks]] and the rest of the Galactic Senate into granting him emergency powers. Investigating two attempted assassinations of Senator [[Padmé Amidala]], Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers Dooku used the identity of a dead Jedi master to secretly arrange the creation of a massive clone army on the Republic's behalf. [[Yoda]] leads the clone army to rescue Obi-Wan, Padmé, and Anakin Skywalker from the Separatists on [[Geonosis]], and the first battle of the war ensues. At the battle's conclusion, Yoda declares: "Begun, the Clone War has". In the final scene of the movie, Anakin and Padmé get married in secret, in violation of Anakin's Jedi vows.

''Revenge of the Sith'' shows the waning days of the three-year Clone Wars, in which clone soldiers and their Jedi generals have fought against the Separatist droid army. After killing Dooku and rescuing Palpatine from the Separatists during their assault on [[Coruscant]], Anakin learns Padmé is pregnant. He becomes troubled by visions of her death in childbirth, and Palpatine lures Anakin to the dark side of [[the Force]] by promising to teach him how to prevent her premature demise. Meanwhile, [[Yoda]] is dispatched to [[Kashyyyk]] to stave off a Separatist invasion, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is dispatched to [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] where he kills [[General Grievous]]. Anakin discovers Palpatine is a Sith Lord, but he defends him against [[Mace Windu]] because he needs Palpatine's knowledge to save Padmé. After Palpatine murders Windu, he dubs Anakin his new apprentice Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the [[clone trooper]]s to execute [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], and clones kill their Jedi generals across the galaxy. Palpatine then dispatches Vader to kill the Separatist leaders on [[Mustafar]] and to issue a "shutdown command" to their droid army. With their demise, Palpatine declares an end to the Clone Wars and the Republic's reformation into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].

=== Animation ===
The [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|2D-animated ''Clone Wars'']] series (2003–2005) depicts several Clone Wars battles and was meant to generate interest in ''Revenge of the Sith''. It also depicts the prelude to the opening battle of ''Revenge of the Sith'' and Palpatine's capture by General Grievous.

Several years later, Lucas chose to reboot the series as a 3D CGI series developed by [[Dave Filoni]]. After several years of production on the new television series, Lucas decided to spin off the first four episodes as [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|a standalone film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, released in 2008, introduces [[Ahsoka Tano]] as Anakin's apprentice and depicts the Republic and the Separatists battling and attempting to gain permission to travel through [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s territory.

The [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|television series that followed]] (2008-2014, 2020) is likewise set against the backdrop of the Clone Wars. The show offers additional details about the clone army's creation, depicts numerous confrontations and developments from the conflict, and portrays the interaction between the clone troopers and their Jedi commanders. For example, the series reveals that each clone has an "inhibitor chip" in his body that makes most of them obey Order 66.

=== Video games ===
[[LucasArts]] also produced video games like ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando|Republic Commando]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2002 video game)|The Clone Wars]]'' that depict the Clone Wars.

==Analysis==
{{See also|Star Wars sources and analogues}}

Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to [[World War II]]. Radio host Clyde Lewis' article on historical similarities in ''Star Wars'' claims that Palpatine's tactics parallel those of Adolf Hitler and [[Nazi Germany]]; both leaders used wars and [[scapegoat]]s to manipulate society's emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groundzeromedia.org/archives/dis/sith/sith.shtml|title=The Sith Sense|year=2005|publisher=Ground Zero|first=Clyde|last=Lewis|access-date=June 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809202417/http://www.groundzeromedia.org/archives/dis/sith/sith.shtml|archive-date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer compares the Clone Wars with World War II in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was a [[baby boomer]], and the dark times featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radicalcenter.net/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=52 |title=Star Wars As Baby Boomer Script |date=April 18, 2006 |publisher=Radical Center |first=Stephen |last=Chambers |access-date=July 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017090951/http://radicalcenter.net:80/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=52 |archive-date=October 17, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Lucas's statements that the conflict in ''Star Wars'' was inspired by the cultural backdrop of the [[Vietnam War]], journalist Chris Taylor said the Clone Wars are a parallel to World War II.&lt;ref name="taylor124" /&gt; Anne Lancashire from the [[University of Toronto]] also points out some similar nomenclature between the Clone Wars and the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Politics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~anne/clones.html|title=Attack of the Clones and the Politics of Star Wars|year=2002|last=Lancashire|first=Anne|website=The Dalhousie Review|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several publications compared the political context of the Clone Wars to the [[Iraq War]]. In claiming that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the United States, an editorial on [[Antiwar.com]] states that ''Star Wars'' "establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/horton.php?articleid=6041|title=Star Wars and the American Empire|date=May 23, 2005|website=[[AntiWar.com]]|publisher=[[Randolph Bourne Institute]]|first=Scott|last=Horton|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that "like Palpatine, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration has been able to feed on people's fears to gain more power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/22284/u.s._politics_in_%22a_galaxy_far,_far_away%22|title=U.S. Politics in "A Galaxy Far, Far Away"|last=Fanelli|first=Brian|date=June 21, 2005|website=[[AlterNet]]|publisher=Independent Media Institute|access-date=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112040111/http://www.alternet.org/story/22284/u.s._politics_in_%22a_galaxy_far,_far_away%22|archive-date=January 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas stated that the Iraq war "didn't exist" when he developed the Clone Wars,&lt;ref name="commondreams.org" /&gt; but he did see parallels between the [[Vietnam War]] that inspired ''Star Wars'' and the war in Iraq.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; ''Star Wars'' producer [[Rick McCallum]] corroborated that the Clone Wars was developed before the Iraq War, adding that Lucas "is a product of Vietnam".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kirotv.com/starwars/5221153/detail.html|title=DVD Is Hardly End For 'Sith' Producer McCallum|date=November 2, 2005|publisher=KIROTV.com|first=Tim|last=Lammers|access-date=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017140929/http://www.kirotv.com/starwars/5221153/detail.html|archive-date=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and critical response==

The author of ''How Star Wars Conquered the Universe'', Chris Taylor, calls the Clone Wars "a major part of Star Wars lore".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its attempt to keep its ''Star Wars'' line of toys active after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), [[Kenner]] devised a storyline that would involve the return of an exiled "genetic terrorist" and his Clone Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Zahn]] said the clones' unexpected appearance fighting for "the good guys" in ''Attack of the Clones''—despite many years of fan speculation that the clones were an invading force—was "wonderfully blindsid[ing]".&lt;ref name="taylor338"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the CGI ''Clone Wars'' television show, Zahn was grateful that [[Lucasfilm]] rejected his initial ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' draft, which involved an insane clone of Obi-Wan created during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Taylor|2014|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first discussions about a sequel to ''Wreck-It Ralph'' began in October 2012, and the new installment went through three different scripts before the filmmakers settled on the final plot. When the film was officially announced in June 2016 as ''Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2'', much of the original cast confirmed they had signed on, with new cast members added in 2018.&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/RalphBreaksTheInternet/writen-material/RalphBreaksTheInternet5bdce3d7655f6.pdf|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet – Production Notes|website=wdsmediafile.com|publisher=Walt Disney Studios|access-date=December 14, 2018|archive-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415172920/http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/RalphBreaksTheInternet/writen-material/RalphBreaksTheInternet5bdce3d7655f6.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Celestino|first=Mike|title=Interview: "Ralph Breaks the Internet" directors Phil Johnston, Rich Moore, producer Clark Spencer on Disney sequel|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2018/09/interview-ralph-breaks-the-internet-directors-phil-johnston-rich-moore-producer-clark-spencer-on-disney-sequel/|work=Inside the Magic|access-date=December 16, 2018|date=September 20, 2018|archive-date=December 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217062718/https://insidethemagic.net/2018/09/interview-ralph-breaks-the-internet-directors-phil-johnston-rich-moore-producer-clark-spencer-on-disney-sequel/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Walt Disney Animation Studios' first animated film sequel to be created by the original film's writing and directing team and is the first sequel from the studio since ''[[Fantasia 2000]]''.&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"/&gt;&lt;!-- This source states Fantasia 2000 and not Winnie the Pooh.

After the events of [[Wreck-It Ralph|the first film]], Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz have stayed best friends, hanging out after work in Litwak's Arcade. Ralph is content with their life, but Vanellope longs for excitement and expresses how bored she has become of ''Sugar Rush''{{'s}} predictability. One night, Ralph sneaks into her game and makes a new track for her. The next day, when Vanellope fights the arcade player's control to test the track, the cabinet's steering wheel breaks. As the company that made ''Sugar Rush'' is defunct, and the cost of a replacement wheel on [[eBay]] is too high, Litwak decides to scrap ''Sugar Rush'' and unplugs the game, leaving its citizens homeless, including a crestfallen Vanellope.

With Fix-It Felix and Tamora Jean Calhoun's help, the Surge Protector finds homes for all ''Sugar Rush''{{'s}} citizens as a short-term measure as they figure out how to save the game. Remembering eBay, Ralph and Vanellope travel to the Internet, a place where websites are buildings in a sprawling city, [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s represent users, and [[Computer program|program]]s are people, via Litwak's new [[Wi-Fi router]]. 

They go to the search engine KnowsMore to find eBay, where they end up winning the auction for the steering wheel by unintentionally spiking the price to {{USD|27,001}}; they have just 24 hours to come up with the funds, or they will forfeit the bid and lose the wheel. On the way out, they run into clickbait salesman J.P. Spamley, who offers them a lucrative job of stealing a car from Shank, the lead character in the popular racing-centered [[MMORPG]] ''Slaughter Race''. They steal Shank's car, but she stops them before they can leave the game with it, saying that there are better ways than stealing to make money on the Internet. She proceeds to make a [[viral video]] of Ralph, and uploads it to video-sharing site BuzzzTube. She directs them to BuzzzTube's head [[algorithm]], Yesss, about earning money for the video. At BuzzzTube, Yesss elates on Ralph's video popularity, and they come up with the idea of making more videos, which will earn them the money for the wheel in no time if given enough views. 

Vanellope offers to help advertise the videos, and Ralph has Yesss send her to "Oh My Disney". There, while escaping from [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper]]s, Vanellope befriends the [[Disney Princess]]es, being encouraged by them to discuss her sense of un-fulfillment and reaching a musical epiphany. Ralph makes enough money to buy the wheel but finds Vanellope talking with Shank about staying in ''Slaughter Race'', having felt home there due to its relative novelty and unpredictability compared to ''Sugar Rush''. Worried of losing his friend forever, Ralph asks Spamley for a way to draw Vanellope out of the game and is brought to the [[deep web]] vendor Double Dan, who provides Ralph with a [[Computer virus|virus]], Arthur, that feeds off [[Computer security|insecurities]] and replicates them. When Ralph unleashes Arthur into ''Slaughter Race'', it replicates Vanellope's glitch, triggering a server reboot. Ralph, Shank and the others help Vanellope escape before the game resets. Vanellope blames herself for the crash, but Ralph confesses to her that the crash was actually his fault. Outraged, Vanellope disowns Ralph and throws away his hero cookie medal.

As a guilt-ridden Ralph finds his now-cracked-in-half medal, Arthur copies Ralph's [[Emotional security|insecurities]] and starts making duplicates of Ralph. The clones overrun the internet in a [[DOS attack]], all chasing after Vanellope to keep her for themselves. Ralph saves her and attempts to lure the clones into a firewall, but they form a giant Ralph monster that seizes them both. Ralph comes to accept that Vanellope can make her own choices, letting go of his insecurities. This also causes the giant Ralph monster and the clones to disappear, and Ralph and Vanellope reconcile. Ralph gives half of the broken medal to Vanellope and they bid each other a heartfelt farewell as Shank has arranged for Vanellope to respawn in ''Slaughter Race''. Back in the arcade, ''Sugar Rush'' gets repaired, and Ralph partakes in social activities with the other arcade characters as he stays in touch with Vanellope over video chat, feeling content with his newfound ability to be independent.

===Writing===
Two working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film, according to head writer Josie Trinidad.&lt;ref name="PlotVersions" /&gt; In one version, Vanellope had become self-absorbed by the Internet, gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users. Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore, and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self.&lt;ref name="PlotVersions" /&gt; A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet-famous celebrity, and would have been challenged by an [[anti-virus program]] named Bev that served as a super cop and would have been the story's villain. Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel, being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward.&lt;ref name="PlotVersions"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-had-a-few-totally-different-p-1829920568 | title = Ralph Breaks the Internet Had a Few Totally Different Plots Before It Was Done | first = Germain | last = Lussier | date = October 25, 2018 | access-date = October 25, 2018 | work = [[io9]] | archive-date = October 26, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181026021642/https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-had-a-few-totally-different-p-1829920568 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Clark Spencer said that "the film is about change. Two best friends are about to realize that the world won't always be the same. The internet is the perfect setting, really, because it's all about change—things change by the second".&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet, stating that "[They] looked at how [they] could make the internet relatable on a human level—like how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie."&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"/&gt;{{rp|3–4}} Reardon, however, said that Disney "didn't want to make the movie about the internet", instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, and to treat the Internet as "the place where the movie takes place".&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"/&gt;{{rp|4}} Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers "didn't want to just give the audience more of that friendship — [people had] to see that relationship grow."&lt;ref name="ProductionNotes"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The designs of scenes within the Internet were based on tours made of [[One Wilshire]] in Los Angeles, as it is one of the world's largest telecommunications centers.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies (outside of Disney) that are represented in the Internet, and strove to include net branding from all across the world.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; They also had to explore various [[Internet meme]]s, making sure to avoid those that lacked long-term presence on the Internet.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet, the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it, in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within ''[[Zootopia]]''.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in ''Zootopia'', where she experienced, learned, and overcame the racism aspects, and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreck-it-ralph-2-wont-shy-away-from-the-internets-/1100-6461930/ | title = Wreck-It Ralph 2 Won't Shy Away From The Internet's Dark Side | first = Michael | last = Rougeau | date = September 20, 2018 | access-date = September 20, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-date = September 20, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180920220412/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreck-it-ralph-2-wont-shy-away-from-the-internets-/1100-6461930/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter [[Pamela Ribon]].&lt;ref name="DisneyPrincessScene"/&gt; In 2014, Ribon was still working on ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to ''Wreck-It Ralph'', Ribon recognized that like the title character of ''Moana'', Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess.&lt;ref name="DisneyPrincessScene"/&gt; When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of ''Zootopia'', Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney.com, the Disney fan-driven website.&lt;ref name="DisneyPrincessScene"/&gt; Further inspiration came from a [[BuzzFeed]] online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was; Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; The script was written by Ribon, which she wanted to include the various tropes of the Princesses, with them making in the final cut for the film. Moore and Johnston were satisfied on the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sirikul|first=Laura|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2018/10/26/the-process-in-making-ralph-breaks-the-internet/|title=The Process in Making 'Ralph Breaks the Internet'|date=October 26, 2018|website=The Nerds of Color|access-date=January 12, 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128030040/https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2018/10/26/the-process-in-making-ralph-breaks-the-internet/|archive-date=November 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmed in Rome, the film was an American production produced independently by brothers Nat and Patrick Wachsburger for Los Angeles-based [[New World Pictures]]. It is considered a [[cult classic]].

==Plot==
In a distant galaxy, a starship searches for the evil Count Zarth Arn (Spinell). Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed.

Meanwhile, smugglers Stella Star (Munro) and Akton (Gortner) run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle ([[Judd Hamilton]]) and Police Chief Thor ([[Robert Tessier]]). Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole disoriented survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who have tracked their hyperspace trail.

Tried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. Stella manages to escape from her prison, but Elle and Thor recapture her, only to inform her the authorities have canceled her sentence; she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton. They are contacted holographically by the Emperor of the Galaxy (Plummer), who thanks them for recovering the starship survivor. 

He informs them that Count Zarth Arn has a secret weapon of immense power hidden away on a planet somewhere. The Emperor orders Stella and Akton to find the Count's weapon. They are offered clemency if they help find two more missing escape pods as well as the mothership, one of which may contain the Emperor's only son. With Thor and Elle accompanying them, Stella and Akton set off on their quest.

They quickly arrive at the location Akton computes for the first escape pod. Stella and Elle take a shuttle from the spaceship and land near the pod on a sandy, rocky beach. There are no living survivors. Stella meets an Amazonian warrior tribe and is escorted to their underground fortress. On arrival, Elle is ambushed, shot and left for dead, and Stella is taken captive. Stella is taken before Amazon Queen Corelia ([[Nadia Cassini]]), who is in league with Zarth Arn. Elle, revealed not to have died, makes his way to the throne room, taking Corelia hostage to secure Stella's release. They escape, but the queen activates a giant female robot which chases them until they are rescued by Akton and Thor.

On an uninhabited, frozen planet, Stella and Elle investigate the mothership crash site. As with the first crash site, they find no survivors. Upon their return to the ship, Thor, who has ambushed and apparently knocked out Akton, reveals that he is an agent of Zarth Arn. Thor locks Stella and Elle outside on the planet's surface, where the temperature drops thousands of degrees at night, but Elle is able to preserve Stella's life by using his energy to keep her heart going while they freeze over in the snow. Meanwhile, Akton revives and battles Thor, killing him and subsequently rescuing Elle and Stella.

Approaching the planet of the third escape pod, their ship comes under attack from the same weapon seen at the beginning of the film, but Akton steers the ship through it, saving them. Stella and Elle, inspecting the pod wreckage, are attacked by cavemen who smash Elle to pieces and abduct Stella, but a man in a golden mask arrives, firing lasers through his eyes, and rescues her. He is revealed to be the Emperor's son, Prince Simon (Hasselhoff). They are again attacked and overpowered by the cavemen, but Akton appears and fights them off with his laser sword; he then reveals that they are standing on the Count's weaponized planet.

Arriving at an underground laboratory, the three are captured by the guards. The Count appears and reveals his plan to use them as bait to bring the Emperor to the planet and then have his weapon self-destruct, destroying the planet, the Emperor and all three of them. He leaves, ordering his two robot golems to keep the group there. Akton engages them in a laser sword duel and defeats the robots, but is mortally wounded and fades away. The Emperor arrives at the planet and fires a green ray from his flagship to "stop time" for three minutes, allowing them all to escape as the planet explodes behind them.

A huge battle commences between the Emperor's armada and the Count's, with the Emperor's soldiers storming the Count's space station; however, the attack fails and the victorious Count gets ready to destroy the Emperor's home planet. With no further options left, the Emperor decides to ram a massive space station, the Floating City, into the Count's space station, destroying them both. Elle has been rebuilt by the Emperor's men. Stella and Elle volunteer to smash the City into the Count's station. They fly the City towards the space station and manage to escape together just as their station crashes into the Count's, finally winning the war.

Stella and Elle are picked up by Simon and the two humans embrace. The movie ends with the Emperor delivering a short victory speech.

* [[Marjoe Gortner]] - Akton: Stella's loyal sidekick, human in appearance but also endowed with considerable mystical powers (including the power to restore people to life). Nothing is truly explained about his nature or his origins. He fights with a laser sword similar to a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[lightsaber]].

* [[Robert Tessier]] - Thor: Chief of the Imperial State Police, and Elle's superior, he turns out to be a traitor working for Zarth Arn. He knocks out Akton on the second planet, believing him dead, but is then killed by Akton, who is able to deflect laser blasts with his hands.
* [[Nadia Cassini]] - Corelia: Queen of the Amazon women on the first planet that Stella and her crew visit. She is an ally of Count Zarth Arn.

In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', director [[Luigi Cozzi]] described ''Starcrash'' as "science fantasy" as opposed to science fiction.&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=57096 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=Starcrash |accessdate=January 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cozzi also stated that although people assume ''Starcrash'' was an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the design of the picture and its script were developed prior to the release of ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; The film's producer and screenwriter, Nat Wachsberger, and his son, producer Patrick Wachsberger, who had just developed the American production company Film Enterprises Productions, signed on to the film in May 1977 during the [[Cannes Film Festival]] after viewing sample work created by Cozzi for investors.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt;

Principal photography began on October 15, 1977 at the [[Cinecittà]] studios in [[Rome]], Italy.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that shooting also took place in [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; The film was scheduled to be completed by mid-December 1977.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; The budget was $4 million.&lt;ref name="New World"&gt;Koetting, Christopher T.; ''Mind Warp!: The Fantastic True Story of Roger Corman's New World Pictures'', Hemlock Books, 2009, p. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Plummer said of the filming, "Give me Rome any day. I'll do porno in Rome, as long as I can get to Rome. Getting to Rome was the greatest thing that happened in that for me. I think it was only about three days in Rome on that one. It was all shot at once". Discussing his role as the Emperor, he said, "How can you play the Emperor of The Universe? What a wonderful part to play. It puts God in a very dicey moment, doesn't it? He's very insecure, God, when the Emperor’s around."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/articles/christopher-plummer-on-the-greatest-piece-of-direc,103813/Christopher Plummer on the greatest piece of direction he ever received-AV Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cozzi stated that the miniatures were completed by Italian artists, while American developers were recruited for the special effects, including snorkel photography, computer photography and mechanical effects.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; Shooting took over six months and was frequently brought to a halt due to financing problems. The film was originally made for [[American International Pictures]],&lt;ref name="mfb-review" /&gt; but after seeing the final cut, they declined to release it. [[New World Pictures]] stepped in instead.&lt;ref name="New World" /&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The score for ''Starcrash'' was composed and conducted by veteran composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2017/10-sci-fi-movies-that-should-be-cult-classics/ 10 Sci-fi Movies That Should Be Cult Classics - Taste of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was given a limited release of 1,500 copies by BSX Records in December 2008, and features 14 tracks of score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviemusic.com/soundtrack/M06891/starcrash/ ''Starcrash''] soundtrack description at [http://www.moviemusic.com MovieMusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
The film premiered in Los Angeles on March 7, 1979.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; At the [[7th Saturn Awards]], it was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film|Best International Film]].

In a contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the film had a "weak screenplay" and that Cozzi's direction "seemed to have no apparent plan".{{sfn|Willis|1985|pp=340-341|ps=: "Review is of a 92 minute version viewed in Hollywood on March 7, 1979"}} ''Variety'' commented that "what is surprising for a picture of this genre, however, is the lacklustre photography by [[Paul Beeson]] and Roberto D'Ettorre and special effects by Armando Valcauda and German Natali", and that the "photography almost never convinces that this is actually taking place anywhere but on the movie screen and special effects seem little more than poor imitations of what's been done before".{{sfn|Willis|1985|pp=340-341|ps=: "Review is of a 92 minute version viewed in Hollywood on March 7, 1979"}} The ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' noted the "mediocre special effects and a clumsily protracted finale", but stated that ''Starcrash'' "intermittently achieves a kind of lunatic appeal as it lurches pell-mell from one casually fabricated climax to the next".&lt;ref name="mfb-review"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]] |title=Starcrash |volume=46 |issue=540 |page=155 |year=1979 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |location=London |last=Pulleine |first=Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrospective review by Kurt Dahlke of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' said, "''Starcrash'' is a masterpiece of unintentionally bad filmmaking. Pounded out in about 18 months seemingly as an answer to ''Star Wars'', Luigi Cozzi's knock-off buzzes around with giddy brio, mixing ridiculous characters with questionably broad acting, an incredibly simple yet still nonsensical plot derivative to ''Star Wars'', and budget special effects that transcend into the realm of real art. It's a completely ridiculous movie, that's great to watch with a few friends and a beer or two. And it still manages to make my jaw drop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/43907/starcrash |title=Starcrash |first=Kurt |last=Dahlke |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=2011-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R. L. Shaffer of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the film a rating of 10/10, declaring it the "single greatest sci-fi camp fest ever put on celluloid" and put it in a league with cult classics like ''[[Troll 2]]'', ''[[Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky]]'' and ''[[The Room]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/112/1122082p1.html |title=Starcrash |first=Randy L. |last=Shaffer |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2011-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Starcrash'' was chosen by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the ''50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 1970s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-lists/50-best-sci-fi-movies-of-the-1970s-163518/starcrash-1978-173563/ |title=50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 1970s – Rolling Stone |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was featured on the movie-mocking television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/mst3k-review-netflix-jonah-ray-joel-hodgson-season-11-1201805884/ |work=[[IndieWire]] |title=‘Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return’ Review: Faces Change, But The Anarchic Spirit Remains the Same |accessdate=May 3, 2017 |date=April 14, 2017 |last=Miller |first=Liz Shannon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spaceballs''''' is a 1987 American [[science fiction comedy]] film co-written, produced and directed by [[Mel Brooks]]. Starring Brooks, [[Bill Pullman]], [[John Candy]] and [[Rick Moranis]], the film also features [[Daphne Zuniga]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[George Wyner]] and the voice of [[Joan Rivers]]. In addition to Brooks in a supporting role, the film also features Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Rudy De Luca]] in [[cameo appearance]]s.

The film's setting and characters [[parody]] the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises and popular films including ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'', and the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''. It was released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/spaceballs-45901 |title=Spaceballs - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1987-06-24 |access-date=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Brooks's most popular films.

==Plot==
Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob schemes to force King [[Roland]] of the neighboring planet [[Druid]]ia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess [[Vespa]] on the day of her [[arranged marriage]] to the [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Prince [[Diazepam|Valium]]. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with ''Spaceball One'', an impossibly huge ship commanded by [[Colonel Sanders|Colonel Sandurz]]. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] spaceship with her droid of honor, [[Dot matrix|Dot Matrix]].

Roland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his "mawg" (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster [[Pizza Hut|Pizza the Hutt]]. In their [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] spaceship, ''Eagle 5'', Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before ''Spaceball One'', rescue both her and Dot, then escape. ''Spaceball One'' tries to follow at light-speed, but Helmet orders the ship to "ludicrous speed", causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance.

Out of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby "desert moon of [[Vega]]". The group travels on foot in order to evade the Spaceballs, but they eventually pass out under the blazing sun. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named [[Yogurt]]. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to "the Schwartz", a [[metaphysics|metaphysical power]] parodying [[the Force]]. Yogurt also introduces the group and the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Lone Starr and Vespa begin to develop romantic feelings for each other, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.

Helmet and Sandurz break the [[fourth wall]] by using a [[VHS]] copy of ''Spaceballs'' to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders ''Spaceball One'' to go to the moon of Vega. When Helmet discovers Yogurt's lair, he lures Vespa out by pretending to be Roland and he succeeds in capturing both her and Dot, and returns with them to planet Spaceball. He then threatens to reverse Vespa's [[Rhinoplasty|nose job]], forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take ''Spaceball One'' to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, ''Spaceball One'' transforms into ''Mega Maid'', a [[Statue of Liberty]]-like [[Mecha|colossal robot]]ic maid with a [[vacuum cleaner]]. The vacuum is activated and begins sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.

Once the air is returned to the planet, the group enters ''Mega Maid'' and attempts to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with [[lightsaber]]-like "Schwartz rings" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship, while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. They subsequently crash-land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''-like population, and possibly giving a second meaning to [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|that film]]'s ending.

With Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt, informing him that the medallion necklace Lone Starr has been wearing reveals that he is a prince, and thus making him eligible to marry Vespa. He reaches Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, then marries Vespa.

==Production==
When Brooks developed ''Spaceballs'', he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Even though the Yogurt character (Mel Brooks) mentions merchandising in the film, Brooks's deal with [[George Lucas]] on parodying ''[[Star Wars]]'' was that no ''Spaceballs'' action figures be made. According to Brooks, "[Lucas] said, 'Your [action figures] are going to look like mine.' I said OK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxim.com/comedians/interview-icon-mel-brooks|title=Interview: Icon Mel Brooks|date=2013-02-06 |first=Patrick |last=Carone|access-date=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/mel-brooks-on-how-to-play-hitler-and-how-he-almost-89843|title=Mel Brooks on how to play Hitler, and how he almost died making Spaceballs |date=2012-12-13|first=Steve |last=Heisler|website=www.avclub.com |access-date=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks also had Lucas's company handle the post-production, saying, "I was playing ball with the people who could have said no." Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved the film, including its story structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Trzcinski|first=Matthew|date=2020-06-17|title=How George Lucas Reacted to the 'Star Wars' Parody 'Spaceballs'|url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-george-lucas-reacted-to-the-star-wars-parody-spaceballs.html/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=Showbiz Cheat Sheet|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he "was afraid [he] would bust something from laughing".&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt;

Pullman got the part of Lone Starr when Brooks and his wife [[Anne Bancroft]] saw him in a play—he had never seen ''Star Wars'' prior to filming.&lt;ref name="pullmanws"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spaceballs-at-30-bill-pullman-says-crew-worried-blue-screen-would-make-go-blind-1011687 |title=''Spaceballs'' at 30: Bill Pullman Says Crew Worried Blue Screen Would Make Them Go Blind |last=Parker |first=Ryan |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Tom Hanks]] for the film. Pullman said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think [Mel] was hurt that they didn't take him up on it&amp;nbsp;... but then it attract[ed] two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. Once that was secured, then he said, "Heck, I'll get somebody nobody knows!" And I got a chance to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/1/13/qa-with-actor-bill-pullman-spaceballs-an-independence-day-se.html|first=Ben |last=Pearson|title=Q&amp;A with Actor Bill Pullman|website=geektyrant.com|access-date=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zuniga initially found Brooks's film parodies "too crass and not too funny", but after working with Brooks, she said, "I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he's also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=142229%7C33753 |title=Spaceballs|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An official soundtrack was released on [[Atlantic Records]] on [[LP record|LP]], [[compact disc|CD]], and [[Cassette tape|cassette]], featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by frequent Brooks collaborator [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]].

The site's consensus reads; "There's fine spoofery and amusing characters in Spaceballs, though it's a far cry from Mel Brooks's peak era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spaceballs/ | title=Spaceballs Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] | work=Rotten Tomatoes | access-date=January 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 46%, based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref name="Spaceballs 1987: Reviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/spaceballs | title=Spaceballs (1987): Reviews | website=[[Metacritic]] | access-date=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics agreed that, while it was funny, doing a ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody ten years after the original film had been released seemed pointless. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked "I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival…it should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for ''Star Wars'' satires had been completely exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870624/REVIEWS/706240301/1023|title= Spaceballs&amp;nbsp;— rogerebert.com | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won Worst Picture at the [[1987 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Winners Database |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1987/1987st.htm |website=The Envelope at LA Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815213631/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1987/1987st.htm |access-date=18 September 2019|archive-date=August 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Spaceballs'' was first made available on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] in February 1988; they were re-released in the late 1990s. The VHS edition was issued twice; the latter edition was presented in widescreen. Meanwhile, the laserdisc also gained a [[audio commentary|commentary track]] with Brooks; this was transferred over to the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases. The film was first released on DVD on April 25, 2000. This version also contained "the making of..." documentary and a collectible "making-of" booklet. The film was then released in the "Collectors Edition" on May 3, 2005. This edition contained more extras including the documentary and the video conversation about the making of the film with Brooks and Thomas Meehan. On August 7, 2012, the "25th Anniversary Edition" was released on Blu-ray containing many of the same bonus features as the 2005 DVD release with the addition of a new featurette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Josh|title=Spaceballs: 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8879|publisher=Blu-ray.com|access-date=September 18, 2012|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] edition of the film will be released on April 12, 2021 by [[Kino Lorber]], with all of the special features from previous home video releases included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kino: Spaceballs 4K Blu-ray Detailed |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=27835 |access-date=December 12, 2020 |work=Blu-ray.com |date=December 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animated series and possible sequel==
''Spaceballs'' was developed into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as ''[[Spaceballs: The Animated Series]]'' on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] (US) and [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Guider | first=Elizabeth | title='Spaceballs' rolls to TV | url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/spaceballs-rolls-to-tv-1117916598/ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January 19, 2005 | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Vozick-Levinson | first=Simon | title=Mel Brooks readies a ''Spaceballs'' cartoon for TV | url=https://ew.com/article/2006/09/26/mel-brooks-readies-spaceballs-cartoon-tv/ | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=September 26, 2006 | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moranis claimed in a 2013 interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential [[sequel]], with Moranis pitching the title ''Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II''. However, he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Abrams | first=Brian | title="You Don't Do Liner Notes With The Dead Sea Scrolls": Rick Moranis In Conversation | url=http://heebmagazine.com/exclusive-rick-moranis-on-spaceballs-2-ghostbusters-3-and-my-mothers-brisket/45895 | work=Heeb | date=June 23, 2013 | access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|next ''Star Wars'' film]] and hopes that Moranis would reprise his role. This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called [[q:Spaceballs#Dialogue|''Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Heller | first=Corinne | title=Spaceballs 2 a Go?

However, in February 2020, Bill Pullman said during an interview with Daily Blast Live, "It's up to Mel. Ask him if he has too much money and that's why he doesn't do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bill Pullman Chats "The Sinner"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMquBNSbGxc|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''Spaceballs'' has made an impact on popular culture and been used as a referent and inspiration in other properties.

[[Tesla Motors]] has used Spaceballs' starship speeds (Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) as inspiration for naming their acceleration modes. In homage to ''Spaceballs'', Tesla has ''Ludicrous Mode'' for acceleration beyond its Insane Mode, and ''Plaid Mode'', overtop Ludicrous.&lt;ref name=Jalopnik-2017-11-17&gt;{{cite news |url= https://jalopnik.com/watch-the-new-tesla-roadsters-plaid-mode-rocket-the-c-1820542817 |title= Watch The New Tesla Roadster's "Plaid" Mode Rocket The Car From Zero To 81 MPH In An Instant |first=David |last=Tracy |date= 17 November 2017 |website= Jalopnik }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysOrg-2015-07-17&gt;{{cite news |url= https://phys.org/news/2015-07-ludicrous-mode-tesla-power-already-fast.html |title= 'Ludicrous Mode'? Tesla adds power to already-fast Model S |agency= Associated Press |date= 17 July 2015 |work= [[Phys.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its [[merchandising]], [[The Boring Company]] sold 20,000 "flamethrowers" in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boringcompany.com/flamethrower |title=Flamethrower—The Boring Company |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=boringcompany.com |access-date=2018-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129102013/https://www.boringcompany.com/flamethrower |archive-date=January 29, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the Spaceballs merchandising scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=937447589460426752 |date=December 3, 2017 |title=The *real* money comes from merchandising.

A {{frac|1|12}}-scale model of the [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]], ''Eagle 5'', was auctioned on December 11, 2018.&lt;ref name=WinnAuc&gt;{{cite web |last=Kautonen |first=Antti |title='Spaceballs' Winnebago Model to Be Auctioned |url=https://www.autoblog.com/2018/11/13/spaceballs-winnebago-auction/ |website=Autoblog |access-date=29 November 2018 |date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was created by film special effects designer, [[Grant McCune]], who also created models for ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref name=WinnAuc/&gt; The model makes an appearance early in the film with the introduction of Barf and Lone Starr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QhUoOwHN8|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Bon Jovi and Barf (1080p) |access-date=17 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model, along with other special effects artifacts from then-current films such as ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' and ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'', was displayed at Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in the summer of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-07-22-8801160797-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2290" xml:space="preserve">'''''Star Wars Theory''''' is a YouTube channel with 2.86 million subscribers, and is a self-described "Star Wars fan making content for other Star Wars fans."

==Content==
As the name suggests, the channel originally began with "Theory" (his nickname) presenting theories regarding the mysteries that were set up by Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. From there, the channel has grown and evolved over the years, with recurring motifs and series' such as: Star Wars Explained, a narration of many of the Star Wars comics, animated (and often humorous) fan fictions, and many others. His 2018 fan film, [[Vader Episode I: Shards of the Past]] has received praise from among the Star Wars fanbase, and has been viewed over 23 million times on YouTube as of February 2021. 

One of the features of his channel is to make predictions in Star Wars media. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=This 'Mandalorian' Fan Theory Suggests Boba Fett Will Rule Mandalore|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/this-mandalorian-fan-theory-suggests-boba-fett-will-rule-mandalore/ar-BB1bMA0P|access-date=2021-01-12|website=www.msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|date=2020-12-22|title=Did Bo-Katan Really Need to Refuse the Darksaber in 'The Mandalorian' Finale?|url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a35047002/mandalorian-bo-katan-darksaber-moff-gideon-star-wars-theory/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=Men's Health|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
