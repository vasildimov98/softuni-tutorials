Dabase Introduction

type of Database: 
MongoDB
Graph DB 
MySQL
SQL Server

Data Management
When do we need a Database?

Storage vs Management

Everything in relation database is based on tables
Flat storage eventually runs into issues in 
Size
Ease of updating 
Searching
Concurrency 
Security
Consistency

A database is organize collection of information
- It improves rules on the contained data

SQL Server saves the data, however SQL Management is the client we use to make queries! 

First propose by Edgar Codd

RDBDS is the sofware 

SQL Server Archiecture
Logical Storage
Instance
Database
Scheme (folders, files and etc)
- the default scheme is dbo(database object)
- PascalCase is the way we right name
Every scheme has Tables
Every tables has rows, cols, constraints

Rules we write time in UTC format

Phisical storage
we save two files and log files

Structured Query Language
To communicate with the Engine we use SQL 
-Declarative language - what we want not how 
Logically divided in four section 

Data Definition - describe the structure / Create/ Drop
Data Manipulation - store and retrive data
Data Control - define who can access the data
Transaction control   

Good practise is to organize data, use new collom
Key words we write in capital letters
