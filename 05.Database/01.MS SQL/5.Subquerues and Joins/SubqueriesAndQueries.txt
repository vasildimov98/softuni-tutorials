Joins and subqueries and CTEs

I. Joins - they are used to take data from diff table

1. Type of joins 
	a. INNER JOIN - returning only rows matching the condition
	b. LEFT/RIGHT JOIN 
	c. FULL OUTHER JOIN 
	d. CROSS JOIN
	
2. INNER vs. OUTER

	A. INNER joins of two tables only rows that are matching a certain condition
	B. LEFT/RIGHT returns the result of the inner join as well as unmatched rows from the left (or right) table
	C. Full outer join returns the result of the inner join along with all unmatched rows
	D. CROSS JOIN is a Cartesian product which is form when: 
		A join condition is omitted
		A join condition is invalid
		All rows in the first table are join to the all rows in the second table
	To avoid a Cartesian product, always include a valid join condition

II. Subqueries - query manipulation on multiple levels
Use a query's result as data for onother query

III. Common table Expressions
- CTE can be consider as named subqueries
