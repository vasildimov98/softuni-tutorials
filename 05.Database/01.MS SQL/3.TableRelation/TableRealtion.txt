Table Relations

I. Database Design

1. Steps in the database design process
- Identify entities
- Identify table columns
- Define a primary key for each table
- Identify and model relationships 
- Define other constraints by type, 
- Fill tables with test data 

Entity tables represent object from the real world
- Most often they are nouns in the specification

Nouns from text are tables, whereas columns sometimes are given in the text

Choosing a primary key
- Always define an additional columns for the primary key 
- Don't use existing columns 
- good idea is to be number! (int, BigInt, GUID)
- Define it as IDENITY to imp auto-increment
- Put the primary key as the first column

EXCEPTION - well know ID, e.g. countries (BG, DE, US) and currency (USD, EUR, BGN)

II Database Normalization

- It is a technique of organizing the data in the database
- Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like inserion, update and deletion enomalies
- It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form removing dublicated data from the relation tables;


- When we update we have to always write correctly the name
inserion, update and delete anomalies
- there diff steps in normalization

1. First Normal Form
- table should only have one value
- Values stored in a column in a table should in same type 
- All the colums in a table should have identity number

2. Second Normal Form 
- we should escape parcial dependancy!

3. Third Normal Form
- no transitive dependancy! 

Table Relations <3

Relationships between tables are based on interconnections primary key -> foreign key;

Custom colum properties

PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, IDENITY

Foreign Key ia an identifier of a record located in another table
Using relationship we refer to data instead od repeating data 

One to many - one town has one country but one country has many towns

Many to many one student has many courses
one courses has many students

One to one - one driver has one driver license
One license has one owner

Cascading - allows when a chnage is made to certain entity, this change to applay to all related  entities1
