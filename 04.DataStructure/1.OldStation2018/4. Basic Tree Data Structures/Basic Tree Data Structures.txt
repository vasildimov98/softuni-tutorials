Basic tree Data Structures

they are Tree-like data structure 
Consisting nodes

Type of trees 

Trees: binary, balanced, ordered, etc.
Graphs: directed/ undirected, weighted...
Networks: graphs with particular attributes

Trees we Node with Edge

Root - the first Node
Parent  - the prevNode -
Child, Siblings - The current element 
Depth[0, 1, 2], Height(3)
Subtree - part of the tree
Leaf - does not have a child
internalNode - has a child and a parent 
Ancestor - the they have direct conection with Nodes 

Tree traversal Algorithm 

DFS - Deep First Search
BFS - Breadth First Search

Binary Trees - has at most 2 children
