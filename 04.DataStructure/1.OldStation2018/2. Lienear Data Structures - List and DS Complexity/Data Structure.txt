Algorithm Analysis

We predict the resources the algorithm need 
for example:

1. computation time 
2. Ram 

The expected running time of a algorithm is 

1. total number of primitive operation execute 

We always look for the worst case cenerio 
Average case 
Best Case - lower bound

higher terms dominate lower 

Algorithm Complexity - rough estimation of the number of steps performed by given computation, depending on the size of the input 
Measured with asymptotic notation 

Big ho of fn
theta of n 
omega of n

Memory Requirement should also be consider

Abstract Data Type 

Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently

e.x. Person = first name, last name, age 
int[]
List<string>()

Array Data Structure - there are build in and lightweight

1. ordered 
2. has fixed size - 

array use a single block of memory

List Data Structure
