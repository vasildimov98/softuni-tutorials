Linear Data Structures
Static and Dynamic Implementation

I. Dynamic Arrays - List

List is the implementation of ADS List build atop an array which is able to dynamicly grow or shrink

1. Operations 
- Constan O(1) - Count, Get and Set
- However Add is amortizied constant - adding the n element requires O(n)
- All other operations are O(n) like Insert, Contains, Remove and so on!

II. Node - Building Block

1. Node class is the build block for many data structures
- Inside it we store the value and at least pointer for the next node!
- However we store anything else!

III. Stack - Dynamic Implementation

1. Constant operations
- Count, Push, Pop, Peek

2. Liear Operations - Contains, find and etc

IV. Queue - is the implementation of ADS FIFO

if don't keep ref to the last element the Enque is O(n), otherwise is O(1).

V. LinkedList - SinglyLinkedList
- Linear data structures where each element is a separate object - Node!
- The elements are not stored at contiguous memory
- the entry point is commanly the head of the list!
